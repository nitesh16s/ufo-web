A continuous ridge connects them but there is still a sharp gap and a considerable distance between them. The East Peak is recognized as a trekking peak, whereas the West is known as an Expedition Peak.\r\nLobuche being an attractive mountain offers various existing routes and also a potential for new ones. The dark triangle of its rocky East face rises over the moraines of the Khumbu Glacier to a spectacular skyline, forming the south ridge.\r\nThe peak of Lobuche East is reached by descending a marked notch and climbing steep snowy slopes to the top. On most occasions, the mountain is climbed on the summit ridge only as far as a subsidiary snow summit, south-east of the true peak and before the notch. This peak is identified as the false peak. Laurence Nielson and Ang Gyalzen Sherpa made the first ascent to Lobuche East on 25 April 1984 although there are possibilities that others have reached the summit before. But no records are available.\r\n\r\nUFORangers offers Lobuche Peak along with an acclimatization trip to Everest Base Camp in Nepal. If you are looking at climbing options along with the Everest Base Camp trek, then the best option would be Lobuche Peak with ample experience of adventure and a taste of Ice Climbing.  Lobuche Peak offers spectacular views of the high Himalaya ranges of Khumbu Valley including Everest, Lhotse, Amadablam, and Makalu.  From the summit, you will get a bird’s eye view of the entire Khumbu glacier.",

            "name": "Lobuche Peak Expedition (6,119m) with Everest Base Camp Trek",
            "about": "The Lobuche peak consists of two different summits, via. East and West with heights of 6,119 m and 6,145 m respectively. A continuous ridge connects them but there is still a sharp gap and a considerable distance between them. The East Peak is recognized as a trekking peak, whereas the West is known as an Expedition Peak.\r\nLobuche being an attractive mountain offers various existing routes and also a potential for new ones. The dark triangle of its rocky East face rises over the moraines of the Khumbu Glacier to a spectacular skyline, forming the south ridge.\r\nThe peak of Lobuche East is reached by descending a marked notch and climbing steep snowy slopes to the top. On most occasions, the mountain is climbed on the summit ridge only as far as a subsidiary snow summit, south-east of the true peak and before the notch. This peak is identified as the false peak. Laurence Nielson and Ang Gyalzen Sherpa made the first ascent to Lobuche East on 25 April 1984 although there are possibilities that others have reached the summit before. But no records are available.\r\n\r\nUFORangers offers Lobuche Peak along with an acclimatization trip to Everest Base Camp in Nepal. If you are looking at climbing options along with the Everest Base Camp trek, then the best option would be Lobuche Peak with ample experience of adventure and a taste of Ice Climbing.  Lobuche Peak offers spectacular views of the high Himalaya ranges of Khumbu Valley including Everest, Lhotse, Amadablam, and Makalu.  From the summit, you will get a bird’s eye view of the entire Khumbu glacier.",

Roberts and Sen Tenzing in May 1953, by following now the same standard route from the Mera La. The ascent to Mera using the standard route from Mera La is technically straightforward, although it requires the crossing of high and difficult passes, can be long and demanding, especially in the event of a heavy snow fall and open maze of crevasses.\r\nWe usually recommend Mera Peak to experienced high altitude trekkers who would like to branch into mountain climbing. If you have done some climbing at high altitude, then Mera Peak will be a brilliant choice. As the climb is not very technical, the true challenge with this mountain is that it will test your stamina and endurance.\r\nThe trek starts with a beautiful approach away from the crowds on the Everest trek.  You trek past remote villages and terrace farms growing rice for the first couple of days, before crossing into the Makalu Barun National Park.  The trek then leads you to the village of Khare which is situated at the snow line, an important point to restock supplies before heading to the Mera Peak Base Camp.  After a long gruelling climb from the High Camp, a gentle slope leads you up to the summit.  The views from both, the high camp, and from the summit are breath-taking, with clear visibility of some the biggest mountains in the world - Everest, Lhotse, Makalu and Baruntse\r\nThe trek nights are usually spent in basic Tea House lodges while the nights of the final climb are spent in fully supported camping with all meals provided.",

This trek is considered as an alternative trek route for Annapurna circuit trekking as the trek encompasses all of the elements of a classic Nepal trekking experience of villages, wildlife, panoramic mountain views, and a range of landscape from forest to high alpine.\r\nMardi Himal at the east of Annapurna under the impressive Machhapuchre is the lowest, the least climbed and visited peak in Nepal. Trekking around its base camp is a shorter trek making it great for first-timers and more experienced trekkers, as it takes around the least explored trail much away from the crowd of trekkers through the south of Annapurna then towards Mardi Himal (5,587m), a prominent peak lying directly under the inspiring summit of Machhapuchare and directly opposite the massive south face of Annapurna 1.\r\nTrekkers visiting Mardi Himal trekking can experience Himalayan ranges, mountain landscapes, natural hot springs, mixed indigenous lifestyle, rhododendron forest, alpine meadows, an abundance of wildlife,  ancient caves, waterfalls, various species of flora and fauna- truly wilderness experience.",

At a staggering height of 5895m, climbing Kilimanjaro gives a unique wilderness experience as you ascend to the tallest free-standing mountain on earth. Gradual ascend of Kilimanjaro offers the chance to marvel its view and unique vegetation.\\r\\nThe mountain rises from a vast expanse of dry savannah while its lower slopes are dense with lush forest.  Despite this dormant volcano being near the Equator, the caldera is covered with ice. There is no doubt that the views from its top are the greatest reward of all. From the summit of Kilimanjaro peak, you can even observe the curvature of the planet. On a clear day, the views stretch as far as the plains of the Masai-Mara, in Kenya.\\r\\nThe Mount Kilimanjaro trek has much more to offer than its awe-inspiring views. Embarking on an expedition to the roof of Africa is like travelling from the Equator to the Arctic. The landscape varies from bush-land to tropical forest; from moorland to heath and alpine desert.\\r\\nWith our experience of high altitude trekking, we strongly recommend the Machame Route for your Kilimanjaro Trek.  This route climbs through the beautiful rain forest and takes you up tothe barren landscape of the Shira plateau.  The Kilimanjaro trek route then leads you around the southern slope of the Barranco gorge, up the Barafu high camp, to reach the summit at Uhuru Peak. Machame route allows you to acclimatize better to the sudden increase in altitude.  It also increases your chances of reaching the Kilimanjaro summit.  With our help, you will soon be standing on the top of the Africa, Uhuru Peak.",

Descending from French pass, we enter the lonely but fascinating area know as Hidden Valley, this place is one of the few true wilderness areas accessible in Nepal, the Hidden Valley stretches away to the north eventually narrowing to a rugged gorge which connects to Upper Dolpa and Upper Mustang. We need to organize full board of camping with necessary guide and porters staffs for this trek. Our staffs carry all the necessary goods and prepare healthy meals during trek.  \r\nDhaulagiri round trek start from Beni bank of Kali Gandaki and Myagdi Khola, follow the Myagdi Khola westwards to Darbang and turn north on a tiny trail that leads through forests into the high country. Much of the route is on snow and glaciers as it crosses French Col, traverses the head of Hidden Valley and crosses Dhampus Pass. Dhawalagiri treks end Marpha and return to Pokhara by flight.\r\nThis is a demanding trek which requires physical fitness, technical knowledge, and determination. We climb with proper rest and acclimatization to reach the high altitude destinations. As we need to camp some of the days, proper camping tool will also be carried.",

You will be able to witness the lifestyle of the inhabitants who still continue to live the same way they lived years before. It’s one of the most beautiful but also the least developed regions of Nepal because of the high passes trail it rarely gets visitors. Until a few decades ago it was forbidden for foreigners to enter now its a restricted area that requires special permit.\r\nWithin the Dolpo region lies the Shey Phoksundo National Park, Nepal's biggest national park , it is also the home to exclusive flora fauna , the blue sheep and snow leopard. It's the very location that  Peter Matheson describes in his bestselling book ‘The Snow Leopard’ and the setting for the Oscar nominated film “The Caravana” or “The Himalaya”. On this trek we pass through beautiful valleys, local settlements, mountains including the holy “Crystal Mountain”, centuries old monasteries and forests of pine, oaks.\r\nAfter exploring the historical sights of Kathmandu and obtaining the special permit required for this upper Doplo trekking we take a flight to Juphal via Nepalganj. Then we trek north on to Shey Phoksundo National Park before joining ancient Nepal Tibet trade route and ascend to Nangdola pass (5110m), stop to enjoy the views of Dolpo valley then head to the pristine Phoksundo Lake full of crystal deep blue fresh water contrasting with the weathered red and brown hills.

Ali Bedni offers you the biggest meadows (bugyal) landscape of India and the never-ending eye-soothing greenery. As you might have guessed from the name is an epitome of meadows with stupendous Himalayan peaks standing tall in the background. The hike is a pleasant walk through the grasslands with cattle grazing, birds chirping and tiny flowers magnifying the elegance. \r\nThe best part of the experience is the moment when you get out of the shades of the forest cover, and see acres and acres of green carpet of Ali meadows sprawled out in front of you. Mt Trishul, stands tall against the blue skies, making for a formidable backdrop. Horses and their foals tear themselves across the turf in an uninhibited abandon while the cattle graze lazily on this bounty. Oh what a treat that is!\r\n Your first glimpse of Mt. Trishul is the backdrop to sprawling Ali Bugyal when you enter it. The mountain becomes even more imposing in Bedni, standing like a sentient guard to the meadow along with Mt Nanda Ghunti. \r\n The Bedni Bugyal is another stop in this meadow country – a strip of vibrant green, overlooking the western valley. Popping right out of this meadow like sentient, silent guards are the mountains of Trishul and Nanda Ghunti. If you climb the Bedni Top, other high risers of the imposing Chaukhamba range open up before you. \r\n On this experience, you will find dense oak and rhododendron forests of Ghairoli Patal along with walnut, pear, Himalayan roses and other flora. You may even spot birds like a flycatcher, and magpies. The evening light on these trees and Mt Trishul that peeks at you from the horizon is picture-perfect. These incredible settings make these twin meadow mighty and must do adventure.",

Even though the trek into the Everest region can be steep &amp; strenuous at some places, it does not require that you have any previous trekking or mountaineering experience neither does it require any technical experience; only that you be in good physical conditioning and be able to hike at a comfortable pace for 4-6 hours over hilly terrain with a light day pack. Good cardio-vascular conditioning and exercises for muscles that are used to hiking will make your trip much more enjoyable. Our goal is to climb Kala Patthar at 18,200 feet and walk on broken glacial moraine all the way into Base Camp at 17,500 feet. You will spend 12&nbsp;days in a land where life is simple, trails are steep and the air is thin. We recommend the following schedule to the participants: We recommend the following schedule to the participants</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Week One:</strong> Participants should develop a habit of being able to get up in the morning and run / brisk walk for a minimum of 3-4 Km at least 3-4 days a week. This would represent at least 20-25 minutes of cardio exercise. Though difficult at first, keep at it. You can stop and take breaks as well. During the day, you should get into the habit of avoiding elevators and taking the steps. You should be able to climb at least 4/5 flights of steps daily. (Avoid going down steps too fast as this could result in some knee injuries). If you Don&rsquo;t enjoy running and are into some other sport like cycling or swimming, spend about 30-45 mins cycling or about 600 &ndash; 800 mts of swimming for at least 4 days a week. You can make a mixed schedule and try to follow it for first week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Week Two:</strong> Assuming you have successfully survived week one and are consistent with your exercise, you can take up the pace a notch. Increase your distance to 5/6 kms per day and 5 times a week, you can additionally go to a gym. Avoid heavy weight training. Focus more on a core workout. These are your muscle groups that run along the length of your body and helps maintain your posture and sustains you during your long hours of working. Make a combination of exercises with running and try to follow it for second week of prepration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Week Three:</strong> In addition to the week Two exercise, one additional feature you should add in Week Three is walking for half an hour during the evenings with a backpack on carrying 3-4 kgs. This could be 2lts of water, some snacks, a jacket etc. This will help strengthen your back and shoulders thus preparing you for the long hours of trekking. If you don&rsquo;t want to just simply walk, also try increasing your time on climbing flight of steps. As compared to week One, you should aim to be able to climb 10-12 flight of stairs comfortably.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Week Four:</strong> Sustenance. Keep up the tempo, sustain the workout. Try avoiding doing anything very rigorous but be consistent with morning and evening walks / runs and climbing flight of stairs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Week Five:</strong> Sustain the workout. Increase only if you feel comfortable. Start doing an additional 10- 15 mins of climbing stairs in the morning / evening with a daypack of 2-3 kg; about 20-25 floors once a day should help increase the stamina and Endurance considerably.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moniter your growth with us&nbsp;contact: info@uforangers.com</p>"

Good cardio-vascular conditioning and exercises for muscles that are used to hiking will make your trip much more enjoyable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;We recommend the following schedule to the participants:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Week One:</strong> Participants should develop a habit of being able to get up in the morning and run / brisk walk for a minimum of 3-4 Km at least 3-4 days a week.

            "manual": "<p>Climbing Mount Kilimanjaro is a physical undertaking, so you should prepare yourself accordingly with a good 3 - 4 months training program. Being in good shape is important in many respects. Obviously, strong, conditioned legs make it easier to walk uphill and downhill for sustained periods of time. General aerobic fitness allows the body to function efficiently with less oxygen. And a fit body is more likely to withstand the stress of consecutive days of hiking and camping. Finally, a positive mental attitude can work wonders for you when fatigue and doubts arise. How hard is it to climb Kilimanjaro? That&#39;s a difficult question to answer because some people don&#39;t train much and fare very well, while others engage in a disciplined training program and succumb to the altitude in a few days. We&#39;ve heard marathon runners tell us that climbing Kilimanjaro is the hardest thing they&#39;ve ever done. The best advice we can give you is to train adequately, as described below, and get yourself in the best possible hiking shape.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>We recommend the following schedule to the participants.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>WEEK ONE/TWO:</strong>&nbsp;The participants should develop the habit of being able to get up in the morning and run/brisk walk&nbsp;for a minimum of 3-4 Km atleast 4-5 days a week. This would represent at least 20-25 minutes of cardio exercise. Though difficult at first, keep at it. You can stop and take breaks as well.&nbsp; During the day, you should get into the habit of avoiding elevators and taking the steps. You should be able to climb at least 4/5 flights of steps daily.

You should start with shorter time intervals, a slower pace, and no weight (in your day pack) and then gradually increase all of the above as your fitness level improves. Remember that on Mount Kilimanjaro, you will walk slowly for prolonged periods and carry probably no more than 2-3nkgs in your day pack. Therefore, in your training, it is better to increase the time interval/distance and keep a slow pace than to shorten the time interval/distance and increase the pace. Try to train three times a week, for at least one hour per session, at a minimum. Please remember, Consistency is the Key here. Do not do anything to exert yourself or something that will increase chances of Injury. Running / brisk walking 4-5 kms for 5 days in a week is far better than running a 20 km on one day of the week and injuring your Knee / Ligaments in the process .

Good cardio-vascular conditioning and exercises for muscles that are used to hiking will make your trip much more enjoyable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We recommend the following schedule to the participants:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Week One:</strong> Participants should develop a habit of being able to get up in the morning and run / brisk walk for a minimum of 3-4 Km at least 3-4 days a week. This would represent at least 20-25 minutes of cardio exercise. Though difficult at first, keep at it. You can stop and take breaks as well. During the day, you should get into the habit of avoiding elevators and taking the steps. You should be able to climb at least 4/5 flights of steps daily. (Avoid going down steps too fast as this could result in some knee injuries). If you Don&rsquo;t enjoy running and are into some other sport like cycling or swimming, spend about 30-45 mins cycling or about 600 &ndash; 800 mts of swimming for at least 4 days a week.

Its rich artistic and cultural heritage is evident where ornately carved balconies mingle with beautiful shrines and temples. If you arrive early, why not check out Durbar Square with its temples, markets and busy atmosphere. It is also worth the climb to visit the Swayambhunath &ndash; the &#39;monkey temple&#39;. Explore the network of street markets and alley bazaars and Pashupatinath.

The journey begins by crossing a bridge, before you trek through a forest, then climb onto a ridge above the wild rapids of Budhi Gandaki River (which is joined from the Tum Khola River in the Tibetan highlands). </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#243f60\"><span style=\"color:black\">You&#39;ll then reach Khursane on a rocky trail, past two tropical waterfalls on a steep, rocky trail clinging to the side of a cliff.

The trail is narrow at first and gently heads up and down, eventually crossing the Tharo Khola to reach Khorlabesi. After more ascending and descending, you&#39;ll arrive at a small hot spring in Tatopani&mdash;a good place to take a break!</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">From here, you&#39;ll climb over another ridge, then cross the Budhi Gandaki on a suspension bridge. You&#39;ll then climb up a staircase and head over a ridge to Dobhan. Upon crossing another suspension bridge over the Yaru Khola, you&#39;ll climb a stone staircase and then drop to the river and climb more stone stairs to Tharo Bharyang. Keep an eye out for neat Gurung villages in the jungle high above, as well as Langur monkeys, which roam the region.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Crossing the west bank of the Budhi Gandaki, you&#39;ll climb over a ridge, trek along the river and then climb towards the village of Jagat..</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Trek Distance: 22 km/ 13.7 miles</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Trek Duration: 6-7 hrs</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Highest Altitude: 1410m/4626ft</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Accommodation: </span><span style=\"color:black\">Tea House</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Meals Included: (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner)</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\"><strong>Day 05: Trek from Jagat to Dyang (1,804m/</strong></span> <strong><span style=\"color:black\">5,917 feet)</span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">After breakfast in the village of Jagat, you&#39;ll make your way through various landscapes and dense sub-tropical forests, as well as small rivers and rustic villages to get to your final destination. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Begin the trek by climbing over a rocky ridge to Salleri, and then descend to Sirdibas. The valley widens a bit as the trail continues to the Ghatta Khola river. You&#39;ll continue walking upstream to a long suspension bridge in Philim, a large Gurung village. From here, the trail turns north just above the lowest house in the village and stays on a fairly level trail as it crosses millet fields to Ekle Bhatti. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The route now enters a steep, uninhabited gorge where you&#39;ll descend to the grassy slopes, and then cross the Budhi Gandaki river. Trek along the west bank for a while, then cross to the east bank before you return to the west side again. The trail widens through the valley and you&#39;ll pass through bamboo forests to the Deng Khola river.

First, cross the Budhi Gandaki river and climb up to the bridge, where you&#39;ll climb a bit further to join a trail from Bhi. Then head west up the valley passing through lush forests, alpine vegetation, and quaint villages housing ethnic groups of the Manaslu region, with major peaks starting to appear in the distance</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Even though there is another route, you will take the trail through Prok. This village has a beautiful vantage point of the snowcapped Siringi Himal. Take a break here and then continue to cross the Budi Gandaki several times today running into several gompas along the way. The trail then follows the river upstream through a dense forest and leads to a narrow gorge. Keep going until you notice the forest becomes less dense. This rewarding part of the walk is a magnificent way to experience the Manaslu Conservation Area. You&#39;ll eventually reach one last steep climb to get you to the village of Namrung. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Trek Distance: 19.5km/12.1 miles</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Trek Duration: 6-7 hrs </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Highest Altitude: 2,630m/ 8,626 feet</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Accommodation: Tea House</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Meals Included: (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner)</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:black\">Day 07: Trek from Namrung to Samagaon (3,530m/</span></strong> <strong><span style=\"color:black\">11,578 feet)</span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">After breakfast in Namrung, you can walk around the village for a good viewpoint of Siring, Ganesh Himal, and also Mount Himal Chuli to the south.

You&#39;ll pass several mani walls as the valley begins to widen. The mountain views along this route are amazing and get you close to the Tibetan border.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">This is an easy trek on a shelf above the river that passes juniper and birch forests in Kermo Kharka. Drop down and cross the Budhi Gandaki on a wooden bridge, and then climb steeply onto a promontory between two forks of the river. You&#39;ll come to a stone archway and continue walking until you find the village of Samdo.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Trek Distance: 16.4 km/ 10.1 miles</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Trek Duration: 4-5 hrs </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Highest Altitude: &nbsp;3,875m/ 12,713 feet</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Accommodation: Tea House</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Meals Included: (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner)</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:black\">Day 10: Rest Day in Samdo (3,875 m/</span></strong> <strong><span style=\"color:black\">12,713 feet)</span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">We start the day early to avoid afternoon wind.

After breakfast, you can either rest in Samdo or choose between two hiking options:&nbsp; </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Option 1</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Take an easy trail up the valley directly behind of Samdo to one of the trade passes headed for Tibet. This route has excellent views of Manaslu along with other Himalayan ranges including Simrang, Hiunchuli, Ngadi, Larkye Peak, Cheo, and possibly Kang Guru behind the pass. En route to these viewpoints, you will pass many seasonal herding settlements called doksas and see some beautiful mountain birds like the Lophophorus (the national bird of Nepal), Lammergeyer, and Himalayan Griffin soaring above. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Option 2</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">A more challenging route is the trek to the Gya La (large pass) north of Samdo&mdash;a more frequently used trading route to Tibet. This is a longer full-day hike and not advised for those seeking a little rest.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Accommodation: Guest House</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Meals Included: (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner)</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:black\">Day 11: Trek from Samdo to Dharamsala/Larkya B.

After breakfast, we head up to the start of the Mera Glacier by climbing a steep ridge that we will later follow to the Mera La pass. Here we will take the opportunity to practice skills needed for glacial travel and organize a session on the glacier. First, we instruct techniques on how to use crampons, rope and ice axe etc. Thereafter, we shall provide training on peak climbing techniques and the proper ways of using climbing gears such as the ice axe, climbing boots and crampons, harness, ascender, etc. The training will also include how to use the ropes to go up and down. This helps us prepare for the summit to Mera. Although it is not mandatory to have prior training/skills for this trek to Mera Peak Base Camp, we strongly believe that some training experience will boost your confidence and your climbing skills to increase the chances of scaling the summit as well as to fully enjoy the experience. Later in the day, we return to Khare for over night&#39;s sleep.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#243f60\"><span style=\"color:black\">Accommodation: </span><span style=\"color:black\">Tea House</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#243f60\"><span style=\"color:black\">Meals Included: (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner)</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:black\">Day 11: Khare to Mera La (5415m) &amp; Base Camp (5350m) </span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#243f60\"><span style=\"color:black\">Today will be an exciting day as if it is the first day of mountaineering where three hours over a boulder-strewn path up to the glacier, leading up to Mera La.

Our freshly learned crampon and ice axe techniques will come in useful while climbing into the glacier. This exposed pass serves as a camp before climbing up to Mera&#39;s high camp the next day. The views from the pass and first experience of mountaineering are spectacular. We first climb up to the Mera La (5,410m) and back up the ridge and then onto the back of the Mera base camp to settle in for good night&#39;s sleep.</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Trek Duration: 4-5 hrs </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#243f60\"><span style=\"color:black\">Highest Altitude: 5415m/17766ft</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#243f60\"><span style=\"color:black\">Accommodation: </span><span style=\"color:black\">Tent</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#243f60\"><span style=\"color:black\">Meals Included: (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner)</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:black\">Day 12: Base Camp to Mera High Camp (5750 m)</span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Today, we head to high camp from base camp; the steep rocky trial leads to the high camp at altitude of 5,800 meters through Mera la pass. It provides an excellent launch pad for the final climb to the summit. Having gained the Mera La, the route turns left (south) and follows easy angled snow slopes. After a short distance an area of crevasses is come in. Under normal conditions, these can be walked around very easily, although looking into their deep, dark depths is always impressive. The crevasses soon give way to slightly steeper but open snow slopes that lead without difficulty to the high camp. Upon arrival at the High Camp, we are rewarded by an excellent panoramic views of Everest, Makalu and the Nuptse, Lhotse wall directly ahead. The setting sun casts an unbelievably magic light on these awesome mountains. We can also see the most of the route to the summit. We get an early night in to prepare for tomorrow&#39;s summit bid.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Trek Duration: 3-4 hrs </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#243f60\"><span style=\"color:black\">Highest Altitude: 5750m/18864ft</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#243f60\"><span style=\"color:black\">Accommodation: </span><span style=\"color:black\">Tent</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#243f60\"><span style=\"color:black\">Meals Included: (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner)</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:black\">Day 13: Summit Mera Peak (6654 m) and trek back to Khare. </span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">We wake up early with hot cups of tea and start heading out into the cold on our way to the summit of Mera Peak. The going is relatively straight forward as we make our way up the Mera glacier and set a slow, steady pace. The route is still non-technical as we climb slowly but surely higher into the ever-thinning air. From the high camp the summit bid will be made early in the morning, and take around 4 to 6 hours to get to the summit. The first rays of the sun hit the big peaks in an amazing red glow. At the foot of the final steep summit cone, we may attach to a fixed rope depending on conditions. The summit is only a few meters away. Shortly ahead is that moment we have all been working so hard to achieve: the summit itself. The slope steepens for a section behind the ridge and the summit comes back into view. The 360 panorama is perhaps one of the most impressive as well as incredible views of Baruntse (7129m), Haling (7319m) and NauLekh (6360m) with Makalu (8481m) looming behind. We are far enough back so that the smaller peaks do not obscure the views, but at the same time are deep in the heart of this fantastic mountainous vista. We spend some time taking it all in before we finally descend back down to Khare for our overnight at lodge which is about 2 hours descent. This is a very long but satisfying day.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Trek Duration: 9-10 hrs </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#243f60\"><span style=\"color:black\">Highest Altitude: 6654m/21831ft</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#243f60\"><span style=\"color:black\">Accommodation: </span><span style=\"color:black\">Tea House </span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#243f60\"><span style=\"color:black\">Meals Included: (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner)</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:black\">Day 14: Buffer Day</span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">We have allocated an extra day as a spare day or contingency day, set aside in case of problems with the weather or acclimatization.

If everything has gone smoothly and you succeed to climb at the summit day, this day is used to covering for next day trek.

Welcome to Nepal. Our journey in Nepal begins today. Our trek representative will be waiting for us at the airport. He/she will then drop us off at our hotel where we can take a rest. Kathmandu, the colourful capital of Nepal, is a fascinating blend of traditional architecture and symbols of the 20th century. Its rich artistic and cultural heritage is evident where ornately carved balconies mingle with beautiful shrines and temples. If you arrive early, why not check out Durbar Square with its temples, markets and busy atmosphere. It is also worth the climb to visit the Swayambhunath &ndash; the &#39;monkey temple&#39;. Explore the network of street markets and alley bazaars and Pashupatinath. For those with a few extra days in Kathmandu, the neighbouring towns of Patan and Bhaktapur are also well worth a visit.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">In the evening we can enjoy a welcome dinner hosted by our team.

Driving on the Prithivi Highway; west from Kathmandu, we will be passing by a beautiful river view of the Trishuli river. In the first few hours, we will reach Dhading Bensi which is the district headquarters of Dhadhing (1050m). In this long drive, we will be stopping for multiple breaks and for lunch as well. From Dhading Bensi, we will be driving to Arughat where the roads will be rough. Along the way, we will see beautiful mountain scenery like Mt. Manaslu and Ganesh Himal range, small villages following the Budhi Gandaki river. Arughat being a large settlement, it is clustered on both sides of Budhi Gandaki river connected by a suspension bridge.

Then we will be walking through the beautiful Sal forest, following the climb onto a ridge above the huge rapids of the Budhi Gandaki river on the way to Liding (750m). Passing through the rocky trails, we reach Khursane. Across Budhi Gandaki are the views of Annapurna Circuit between Bahundanda and Syange that looks incredible. Soon after, we will be trekking down rice terraces taking us to Lapubesi; a Gurung village. The path takes us where the valley opens up and the Budhi Gandaki wanders among wide gravel bars.

Crossing the Tharo Khola, we will reach Khorlabesi. We slowly begin to gain elevation. As we trek, we pass through a natural hot spring at Tatopani meaning &lsquo;hot water&rsquo; in Nepali. Continuing the trek, we walk through the valley as it gets narrower but nature&rsquo;s beauty does not cease to fail us in the attractiveness. We climb over a ridge, then we cross the Budhi Gandaki river via a suspension bridge. Witnessing picturesque villages, we climb on a wide well designed staircase across a landslide then over a ridge that takes us to Doban. As we ascend up to the Budhi Ganadaki river, we arrive at Yaru Khola that takes us further to a stone staircase with prayer flags hung on the way. We climb more stairs to Tharo Bharyang. Along the route, we pass through paved stones along with mani walls and high overlooks over rivers.

As we trek, we will notice the welcome board, so we head towards Lokpa. On the way, we will see a few villages and rivers. The rivers begin to narrow down as we meet the convergence of the Syar river from the Tsum valley. Taking a right turn, the trail takes us forward, eventually reaching the Lokpa village. This village is the first village in the Tsum valley that gives us the opportunity to view the beautiful Manaslu range.

This cave is one of the most sacred caves in the Tsum Valley. It is located at the foot of a rugged cliff near the village of Burji. The famous Tibetan saint called Milarepa was believed to have meditated in that cave as his footprint is imprinted on the cave. The route further is a very pleasant trek, as we will be walking past green meadows and the landscape become fertile and narrow. The farmers will be busy farming.

Further with a steep climb through pine, juniper, and rhododendron forest, the track starts to traverse at a mani wall with many prayer flags hung. This sight of the Tibetan culture is absolutely beautiful. Finally, in the forest, there is a prayer flag that marks the uphill trail and makes a zigzag climb through a big silver pine to reach the Gompa in Lungdang. Rhododendrons will be seen blooming everywhere. If this trek is done during the spring season, the view will definitely be breathtaking seeing nature capture our eyes and mind. This small gompa has forty nuns and an intense puja from 6:00-7:30 pm every night unless the nuns are on holidays which could be for some months in a year.

From the quite bare country around Tarap, we descend towards a wide valley which eventually narrows into a gorge. We walk along the juniper bush and wild rose, typical of dry inner Himalayan valleys, to just above the tree line. On this route we might see herds of blue sheep. By the afternoon time we reach at the confluence of the Tarap Chu and the Lang Khola, a stream that joins with Tarap River from further east.

There are many possible campsites by the river. This will be one of the exciting days of this trip walk, as the valley becomes so narrow in a deep gorge that in some places we can jump from one side to another. Sometimes there is no trace of any path and we have to walk across stone slabs fitted on logs in between the walls which act as a bridge. The gorge also provides unexpected adventure and thrills. At some places, the bridges are either damaged or washed away and we may be forced to cross the icy torrent on foot.

On a clear day the panoramic views of the Himalaya are sensational, including Everest, but particularly exciting is the approach through the Bhutanese foothills and the landing, including a few steep turns to land at the tiny airstrip of Paro. In Paro you will be received by your Bhutanese guide and transferred to the capital town of Thimphu (1 hr drive).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:black\">Road from Paro to Thimphu:</span></strong><span style=\"color:black\"> The distance of about 55kms from Paro town takes little less than 1 hr. with recently broadened road. Drive south following Pachu River to the river confluence at Chuzom, which is also the hub of road network going to Paro, Haa, Thimphu and Phuntsholing. From Chuzom, the road follows Wangchu River upstream as you pass through villages and suburbs to the capital, Thimphu. En-route, you can stop to view Tachogang temple and the nunnery at Sitsina.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:black\">Thimphu:</span></strong><span style=\"color:black\"> (at 2300m) is Bhutan\\&acute;s capital city and center of government, religion and commerce. About two hours drive east from Paro is this a unique city with unusual mixture of modern development alongside ancient traditions. Home to civil servants, expatriates and monk body, Thimphu maintains a strong national character in its architectural style. It was a wooded farming valley until 1961, when it became Bhutan\\&acute;s official national capital. The massive Tashicho Dzong, about 700 years old, was carefully revamped in the 1960s by the late King Jigme Dorji Wangchuk to house the royal and main government offices. Even today, it still only has a few streets and no traffic lights with estimated population of 70,000 people. Thimphu has many places and sights to visit, in addition to several day excursion possibilities. It has relatively more choice in terms of the accommodations.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:black\">Tashichho Dzong:</span></strong><span style=\"color:black\"> This fortress serves as the office of the King, ministers and various government organizations.

It is also the venue for Thimphu Festival in the fall season. Weekend Market of Thimphu: starts around noon on Friday and ends on Sunday afternoon. It resembles the farmers market in the west. However since there are no big super markets, Thimphu\\&acute;s weekend market is the main source of fresh produce. It is an interesting place to visit, where village people jostle with well heeled Thimphu residents for best and cheapest vegetable and other food products. Zangto Pelri Lhakhang: Located near the Weekend Market area is one of the tallest temples and was built in 1990s by a local resident. Zangdopelri refers to the celestial abode of Guru Rinpoche.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#243f60\"><span style=\"color:black\">Accommodation: Hotel (1 night)</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#243f60\"><span style=\"color:black\">Meals Included: Lunch, Dinner </span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:black\">Day 02: Thimphu Sightseeing</span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">There are a good many things to see in the capital which has a very relaxed, laid-back feel about it.

On one side is the Paro and on the other side is Haa valley. After brief stop on the pass (as you won&rsquo;t stay long because of the strong current of wind) continue driving downhill to the forbidden district of Haa (closed to tourist until 2006). Take a tour of Haa valley and visit chorten Nagpo and Karpo and Haa Dzong if permissible. Lunch at restaurant and drive back to Paro.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">On your way back to Paro, If ypou feel like to stretch the legs you will stop at a place for the hike to a monastery called Dzondrakha which looks similar to famous Tiger&rsquo;s Nest monastery but located at shorter hiking distance. If you are energetic - walk along the agricultural field and very easy, another half will be an uphill climb and when both versions of hikes are summed up it will take less than 1 hour to reach at the top where the monastery stands. On reaching the site of the monastery, one would enjoy the view of the fertile Paro valley below. Your guide will take you inside the main temple of the monastery.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:black\">Option 2: Hike to Takstang on Pony ride </span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">You can ride the pony up to the cafeteria for stunning view of the most well known Himalayan Taktshang monastery. While coming back it is easier to walk downhill rather than riding pony which will prove dangerous.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:black\">Taktshang - Tiger\\&acute;s Nest:</span></strong><span style=\"color:black\"> Tiger\\&acute;s Lair or Tiger\\&acute;s Nest as it often referred to for Taktshang Pelphung monastery, is one of the most venerated and famous of Bhutan\\&acute;s monasteries. It is located on the face of a sheer 900m cliff above the floor of Paro valley. It is an impressive and un-miss-able sight but accessible only by walk or to ride mules/pony. If you need the riding horse, you must ask your local guide to arrange it on the previous day. From the trail head (2600m), the walk till the Cafeteria is a steep one hour uphill (about 350m ascent). From the Cafeteria (2940m) and areas around it, one can get a good close-up view of Taktshang. Savor views of the monastery over a well-deserved cup of tea and biscuits at the cafeteria.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">For those who wish to proceed further from here, one must be able to walk. Usually Ponies/horses will not take people beyond this point and neither will they take you downhill. From the cafeteria, trail continues uphill for another 45 minutes to a high observation point (3140m) where there is a Chorten (stupa). From this vantage point, the lookout to the monastery is a very spectacular and seems almost close enough to touch. It is now on the other side of a deep chasm, only around 150m away as bird flies, but takes half hour or even more to reach. Continue down the flight of cliff-hanging steps on the narrow trail to a beautiful waterfall that plunges down the deep chasm and alongside is a retreat hermitage, jammed dramatically into a rock crevice. Then climb up the flight of steep steps to the monastery. At any point on this walk, you can always return if you find it too difficult. Once inside the monastery, there are several shrines or temples to see with few monks in residence. After visiting Taktshang monastery&acirc;&euro;&trade;s many shrines, most tours schedule lunch at the Cafeteria upon return. After lunch, retrace back to the road-head where you started in the morning. The retrace back is all downhill and always on foot as it is not suitable for riding pony/horse. Please note that proper walking boots is recommended for this hike. Further, if you have more time and ready for more challenging day, there are several monasteries, temples, retreat houses in the surrounding area of Taktshang. The most notable among them are Zangdopelri and Ugyen Tsemo as described seperately.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">According to the legend, Guru Padmasambhava or Guru Rinpoche, who spread the Buddhism across the entire Himalayas is said to have flown here in the 8th century on the back of a Tigress, in order to subdue negative spiritual forces that were hostile to spread of Buddhism. In 853, one of his students, Pelgyi Senge mediated here in the main cave. A Stupa inside one of the temples contains his mortal remains and therefore the cave is known as \\&acute;Pelphung \\&acute;or \\&acute;Pelgi\\&acute;s cave\\&acute;. Subsequently many great spiritual masters such as Milarepa, Thangthong Gyalpo, Phajo Dugom Zhigpo, Shadrung and many others passed periods here in profound meditation. In 1692, Tenzin Rabgye built a two storey temple around what little may have existed previously. This was expanded and refurbished many times over the period of time. Taktshang and several temples in the area were burnt down in 1951 by fire accident but much of them remained intact and most of the relics were saved. Soon after, it was rebuilt by entire population of Tsento village. Again in April of 1998, a major fire destroyed the main structure of the building and it\\&acute;s contents. Reconstruction began in 2000 and was completed and consecrated after extensive efforts and financial support of Governments as well as donors.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:black\">Beyond Takstang Description:Takstang</span></strong><span style=\"color:black\"> (Tiger\\&acute;s Lair) - or Taktsang Pelphung is one of the most venerated and famous of Bhutan\\&acute;s monasteries. It is located on the face of a sheer 1000m cliff above Paro valley. It is an impressive sight but accessible only by trek or on pony.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The walk to the Tea house is a steep one hour uphill (about 350m ascent). From the tea house or Cafeteria (2940m), one can get a close-up view of Takstang and most actually return back from here. After tea, snacks and rest, we will trek further uphill to a high observation point (3140m), where there is a Chorten (stupa). Continue down the flight of cliff-hanging steps on the narrow trail to a beautiful waterfall that plunges down the chasm and alongside is a retreat hermitage.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Legend has it that Guru Padmasambhava, the great Buddhist master of Oddiyana (present day in Pakistan), who spread the Buddhism across the entire Himalayas is said to have flown here in 8th century on the back of a Tigress, to subdue negative spiritual forces that were hostile to spread of Buddhism. In 853, one of his students Pelgyi Senge mediated here in the main cave. A Stupa at the main cave contains Pelgyi\\&acute;s mortal remains and therefore the cave is therefore known as Pelphung or Pelgyi\\&acute;s cave. Subsequently many great spiritual masters passed periods here in profound meditation. In 1692, Tenzin Rabgye built a two storey temple here, which over the period of time was expanded and refurbished. In April 1998, tragically, two of the three temples were completely burnt by fire. It has now been restored to its original splendor. After returning from the visit to monastery, we will hike further uphill from the observatory point (described earlier) to Zangdopelri temple (3250m). From here, we can actually look down on the temple, with air distance of not more than 500 meters, providing a unique view. Then if you are can, we can trek for another &Acirc;&frac12; hour further up to Ugyen Tsemo temple with great view of the valley. Depending on the trail conditions, after Ugyen Tshemo, you can walk back using different route which joins at the end. Return to Paro.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:black\">Drukgyel Dzong:</span></strong><span style=\"color:black\"> Drukgyal Dzong ruins is located 14kms north of Paro town, near the end of the paved road. Drukgyal Dzong (victories fortress) was built around 1644-49 to commemorate the Bhutanese victory over the Tibetan-Mongol forces. It was later burnt in fire accident in 1951. On a clear day, Mt. Jumolhari, Bhutan\\&acute;s holy peak is seen against its backdrop.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#243f60\"><span style=\"color:black\">Accommodation: </span><span style=\"color:black\">Hotel</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#243f60\"><span style=\"color:black\">Meals Included: (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner)</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:black\">Day 06: Departure Transfer</span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#243f60\"><span style=\"color:black\">After breakfast, drive to Paro International airport for onward destination.</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#243f60\"><span style=\"color:black\">Meals Included: Breakfast</span></span></span></p>"

The team members of UFORangers will be carrying all the necessary gear, equipment, and first aid kits and they have extensive first aid training. If a trekker falls sick at a high altitude, the leader will decide whether to continue the trek. In case of emergency, UFORangers has a rescue helicopter to bring you back from the higher elevation. Moreover, UFORangers also provides an oximeter to monitor the oxygen levels at high altitudes and offers regular health check-up facilities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How to avoid altitude sickness in Trekking/climbing?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Cut off caffeinated, alcoholic, and smoking items.</li>\r\n\t<li>Drink at least 4 liters of water a day.</li>\r\n\t<li>Trek slow.</li>\r\n\t<li>Don&#39;t skip the acclimatization days.</li>\r\n\t<li>Better to continue with Diamox (if any symptoms show up).</li>\r\n\t<li>Drink Garlic Soup.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How long do I need to walk per day during my trek to Trekking/climbing?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The hiking will be 5-7 hours a day depending upon the landscape and destination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Is Lukla Airport convenient for the flight?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lukla is at 9,500 feet 2,850m above sea level. The higher the altitude, the lower the air density. So, the planes need to land at faster speeds. The weather in this area changes constantly and the cloud cover can be extreme, leading to major turbulence, which, though not dangerous, tends to be tough for passengers to endure. However, it is actually the country&rsquo;s busiest airport serving as the key port of entry and exit for trekkers hoping to ascend Everest. UFORangers will try to make your flight pleasant in any circumstances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What if my flight to and from Lukla is cancelled or delayed?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The flights are usually regular between October and May. But due to high altitude, bad weather, and unforeseen technical issues, you may experience a delay or cancellation of the flight. On the occurrence of such events, UFORangers charters a helicopter to make sure you are on the safe schedule either for the trek or for your flight back home which would cost extra charge as an unexpected event. However, if the visibility is less than 1,500 meters, it is unable to operate helicopter facilities and UFORangers will reschedule the flight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Do I need any permits before starting the trek /climbing?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>You need Climbing Permits and Sagarmatha National Park Entry Permit.

UFORangers will help you to get travel insurance for potential altitude sickness and unforeseen events due to sudden climate change.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What about the Insurance of guides and porters?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>UFORangers ensures the expenses for insurance of its guides, porters, and all the crews along with meals, salary, lodging, transportation, and other necessary equipment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Is there any luggage limit for porter?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>UFORangers will provide one porter for two trekkers to carry 18 kgs of luggage (maximum 9 kg for each trekker).

The team members of UFORangers will be carrying all the necessary gear, equipment, and first aid kits and they have extensive first aid training. If a trekker falls sick at a high altitude, the leader will decide whether to continue the trek. In case of emergency, UFORangers has a rescue helicopter to bring you back from the higher elevation. Moreover, UFORangers also provides an oximeter to monitor the oxygen levels at high altitudes and offers regular health check-up facilities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How to avoid altitude sickness in Trekking/climbing?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Cut off caffeinated, alcoholic, and smoking items.</li>\r\n\t<li>Drink at least 4 liters of water a day.</li>\r\n\t<li>Trek slow.</li>\r\n\t<li>Don&#39;t skip the acclimatization days.</li>\r\n\t<li>Better to continue with Diamox (if any symptoms show up).</li>\r\n\t<li>Drink Garlic Soup.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How long do I need to walk per day during my trek to Trekking/climbing?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The hiking will be 5-7 hours a day depending upon the landscape and destination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Is Lukla Airport convenient for the flight?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lukla is at 9,500 feet 2,850m above sea level. The higher the altitude, the lower the air density. So, the planes need to land at faster speeds. The weather in this area changes constantly and the cloud cover can be extreme, leading to major turbulence, which, though not dangerous, tends to be tough for passengers to endure. However, it is actually the country&rsquo;s busiest airport serving as the key port of entry and exit for trekkers hoping to ascend Everest. UFORangers will try to make your flight pleasant in any circumstances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What if my flight to and from Lukla is cancelled or delayed?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The flights are usually regular between October and May. But due to high altitude, bad weather, and unforeseen technical issues, you may experience a delay or cancellation of the flight. On the occurrence of such events, UFORangers charters a helicopter to make sure you are on the safe schedule either for the trek or for your flight back home which would cost extra charge as an unexpected event. However, if the visibility is less than 1,500 meters, it is unable to operate helicopter facilities and UFORangers will reschedule the flight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Do I need any permits before starting the trek /climbing?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>You need Climbing Permits and Sagarmatha National Park Entry Permit.

UFORangers will help you to get travel insurance for potential altitude sickness and unforeseen events due to sudden climate change.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What about the Insurance of guides and porters?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>UFORangers ensures the expenses for insurance of its guides, porters, and all the crews along with meals, salary, lodging, transportation, and other necessary equipment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Is there any luggage limit for porter?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>UFORangers will provide one porter for two trekkers to carry 18 kgs of luggage (maximum 9 kg for each trekker).

Each day, we monitor each trekkers SPO2, Blood Oxygen Saturation, with a portable Oximeter, to ensure they are acclimatizing well. Our senior guide will keep monitoring the team on a daily basis to ensure that there are no problems along the way. Kilimanjaro is notorious for steep trails and fast altitude jumps often leaving climbers exhausted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What are the food arrangements?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meals will be as close to home cooked food as possible with both Vegetarian &amp; Non Vegetarian options available. Breakfasts will consist of bread, honey, jams, tea and coffee along with eggs, etc. For lunch there will be sandwiches, fruits, pancakes, boiled potato or boiled eggs as part of your full packed lunch. Dinner will usually be a soup followed by lentils, vegetable curry, with pasta, spaghetti etc... Our endeavour will be to try ensuring a daily variety in the food that we prepare so we keep the group&#39;s appetite up along with their morale.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Will I be able to take a shower or bath during the course of the climb?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Regular shower facilities will be available in the hotel, but while we are higher up on the trek, shower facility is not available for the trekking period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What are the emergency medical precautions available for this trek?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our staff and guides carry a fully equipped medical kit with necessary medicines and an Oxygen meter. As a standard practice, we check oxygen levels of all our clients twice a day and take necessary precautions if any irregularity is found in the oxygen reading. In case the problem persists, the client is sent down with a qualified guide. In case of an Injury where the trekker is not in a position to walk down, our staff will guide and if necessary carry you down. Each campsite has an exit out of the national park to the closest road head where a vehicle and a doctor visit can be organized in Moshi town.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What happens in case of bad weather on the mountain?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We usually plans all it treks during the most favorable season on the mountain, but having said that, weather is always an unpredictable factor. We usually look at weather reports before leaving for the trek. In case the weather is unfavorable, we could delay it to the next day depending upon the Itinerary. A buffer day/s is always built in the itinerary as contingency if we get hit by unfavorable weather conditions. In the worse situation, we may have to turn back midway, but safety is always a priority which cannot be compromised on.</p>"

The team members of UFORangers will be carrying all the necessary gear, equipment, and first aid kits and they have extensive first aid training. If a trekker falls sick at a high altitude, the leader will decide whether to continue the trek. In case of emergency, UFORangers has a rescue helicopter to bring you back from the higher elevation. Moreover, UFORangers also provides an oximeter to monitor the oxygen levels at high altitudes and offers regular health check-up facilities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How to avoid altitude sickness in Trekking/climbing?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Cut off caffeinated, alcoholic, and smoking items.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Drink at least 4 liters of water a day.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Trek slow.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Don&#39;t skip the acclimatization days.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Better to continue with Diamox (if any symptoms show up).</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Drink Garlic Soup.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How long do I need to walk per day during my trek to Trekking/climbing?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The hiking will be 5-7 hours a day depending upon the landscape and destination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What if my flight to and from Bhadrapur is cancelled or delayed?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The flights are usually regular between October and May. But due to high altitude, bad weather, and unforeseen technical issues, you may experience a delay or cancellation of the flight. On the occurrence of such events, UFORangers charters a helicopter to make sure you are on the safe schedule either for the trek or for your flight back home which would cost extra charge as an unexpected event. However, if the visibility is less than 1,500 meters, it is unable to operate helicopter facilities and UFORangers will reschedule the flight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Do I need any permits before starting the trek /climbing?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>You need Climbing Permits and Sagarmatha National Park Entry Permit.

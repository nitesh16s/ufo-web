            "content": "<p><span style=\"color:#000000\"><em><strong>What Are The 7 Summits? </strong></em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\">So what are the 7 summits? Well, the 7 summits are the 7 highest mountains on each continent and summiting them is no joke. There are few (if any) mountaineering accomplishments more impressive than successfully climbing them. It takes years, if not decades to complete the feat. It&rsquo;s a huge dream of lots of climbers, adventurers and explorers to summit the highest point on each continent in their lifetime. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\">While everyone agrees that the Seven Summits are the highest peaks on each continent, there&rsquo;s some controversy as to which peaks should be included on the list. The debate centers around the boundaries of some continents, and whether or not it should be the tallest mountain in all of Oceania or just Australia.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\">Two most popular versions of the Seven Summits contain most of the same peaks, with one exception. The <strong>Bass version</strong>, named for American climber Dick Bass, who completed the summits in April 1985, includes Australia&rsquo;s Mount Kosciuszko. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#f1c40f\"><em>Everest, Aconcagua, Denali, Kilimanjaro, Vinson, Elbrus, Kosciuszko (the Bass version)</em></span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\">There&rsquo;s also the <strong>Messner list</strong>, completed by legendary alpinist Reinhold Messner just a year and a half later, which replaces Kosciuszko with Carstensz Pyramid, the highest peak on the Australasian continent. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#f1c40f\"><em><strong>Everest, Aconcagua, Denali, Kilimanjaro, Vinson, Elbrus, Puncak Jaya (the Messner version)</strong></em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color:white\"><a href=\"http://www.snowbird.com/dickbass/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color:#000000\">Dick Bass</span></a><span style=\"color:#000000\">&nbsp;the first 7 Summiter, choose Australia as one of the 7 continents and Kosciuszko as it&rsquo;s mainland high point. However Canadian Pat Morrow, who was competing with Bass to finish the 7, challenged Bass&rsquo;s summit of Australia&rsquo;s Mt. Kosciuszko as the highest peak in Oceania saying that Carstensz Pyramid on Irian Jaya (Papua) in Indonesia&rsquo;s New Guinea was the true highpoint for the Australasian continental mass. Italian Reinhold Messner jumped in and agreed with Morrow. Today Carstensz is considered one of the seven but some 7 Summiteers try to bag the lower Kosciuszko to meet both the Bass and the Messner lists. Of the 416, 7 Summiters, 148 have summited both Carstensz and&nbsp;Kosciuszko.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color:white\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/www.alanarnette.com/images/mountaingiffs/2nd7summits.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color:#000000\">.</span></a><span style=\"color:#000000\">So I guess if you want to cover all angles here is the list:</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"color:#000000\"><span style=\"background-color:white\">Everest, Nepal &ndash; 29,035&rsquo;/8850m</span></span></li>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"color:#000000\"><span style=\"background-color:white\">Aconcagua, Argentina 22,902&rsquo;/6960m</span></span></li>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"color:#000000\"><span style=\"background-color:white\">Denali, Alaska &ndash; 20,320&rsquo;/6194m</span></span></li>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"color:#000000\"><span style=\"background-color:white\">Kilimanjaro, Africa &ndash; 19,340&rsquo;/5896m</span></span></li>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"color:#000000\"><span style=\"background-color:white\">Elbrus, Russia &ndash; 18,513&rsquo;/5642m</span></span></li>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"color:#000000\"><span style=\"background-color:white\">Vinson, Antarctica &ndash; 16,067&rsquo;/4897m</span></span></li>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"color:#000000\"><span style=\"background-color:white\">Carstensz Pyramid, New Guinea &ndash; 16,023&rsquo;/4884m</span></span></li>\r\n\t<li><span style=\"color:#000000\"><span style=\"background-color:white\">Mt.

Right </em></strong></span></h4>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\">The only way to achieve big things is to set big goals, so let&rsquo;s give it a crack. I&rsquo;m currently 27 years old and I&rsquo;m aiming to complete this before I&rsquo;m 30. But enough about me, let&rsquo;s have a look at the 7 Summits and what they represent.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\">In order of height:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\"><em><strong>1. Asia:&nbsp; Mount Everest, Nepal, 8,848 m (29,029 ft) &nbsp;(27&deg;59&prime;17&Prime;N 86&deg;55&prime;31&Prime;E)</strong></em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\"><span style=\"background-color:white\">The mother of all mountains, Everest is the highest point on the planet and, as such, is a major mountaineering objective. Everest is on the border between Nepal and Tibet (China). It is in the Himalaya mountain range which stretches 1500 miles from Northeastern Pakistan to Bhutan. There are over thirty mountains higher than 25,000 feet and fourteen over 26,300 or 8000 meters. Of the fourteen 8,000 meter peaks, nine are located in the Himalayas making it clearly the top of the world First famously ascended in 1953 by Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay, Everest is without a doubt the best-known peak in the world.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:27px\"><span style=\"color:#000000\"><img alt=\"Everest Base Camp\" src=\"/media/upload/rahul/2021/03/20/ebc.jpg\" style=\"height:375px; width:500px\" /></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:27px\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\"><em><span style=\"background-color:white\"><strong>How long does it take?&nbsp;</strong></span></em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\"><span style=\"background-color:white\">The answer is approximately 2 months (65 days), maybe a little more.&nbsp;&nbsp;Climbers start arriving at the mountain&rsquo;s base camps in March. On the more popular south side, base camp is at around 5,300 meters (Everest base camp) and sits at the foot of the icefall ( Khumbu icefall), the first major obstacle. Climbers now acclimatize&nbsp;by climbing nearby, &lsquo;smaller&rsquo; peaks. The next major staging post is Camp 2 (Advanced Base Camp), at the mouth of the Western Cwm.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\"><span style=\"background-color:white\">From there climbers continue to Camp 3 and Camp 4 on the South Col. Sherpas rarely stay at Camp 3, since it is exposed to loose rock fall. D day (Summit day), usually a date in mid May when temperatures are warmer and winds milder, actually begins at around midnight. Climbers aim to be on the summit in the morning, with plenty of daylight left to get down before nightfall.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\"><span style=\"background-color:white\">After successfully completing acclimatization period, the actual summit push from Base Camp and back lasts about a week.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\"><em><span style=\"background-color:white\"><strong>Range/Grading, Difficulty level</strong></span></em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\"><span style=\"background-color:white\">Himalayan /4E, 10/10</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\"><em><span style=\"background-color:white\"><strong>How hard is it?</strong></span></em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\"><span style=\"background-color:white\">It&#39;s extremely tough Mount Everest death rate is about 1.3% or so, but thankfully dropping every year because of better rescues and monitoring systems.

You can pay up to $100k for extra sherpas, extra tents/space/oxygen etc, but most struggle by on a thrift $50k! The fee to the Nepalese Government is $11k+ alone. Once you pay $50k+ you&rsquo;ll most likely be with a Western guide along with local Sherpas, less than $50k and it will more likely be a local operation.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\"><em><span style=\"background-color:white\"><strong>Success Rate in 2018:&nbsp;</strong></span></em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\"><span style=\"background-color:white\">Mount Everest success rate is roughly 50%</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\"><em><span style=\"background-color:white\"><strong>2.

A German team was the first to reach its summit in 1897, and it&rsquo;s been a popular challenge for adventurers ever since. Most climbers fly into Santiago (Chile) or Mendoza (Argentina) and take a bus to Puente del Inca for the normal route or to Penitentes for the Polish Glacier, Polish Traverse and Vacas routes. The so-called &quot;Normal Route&quot; follows Aconcagua&rsquo;s northwest ridge and is among the world&rsquo;s highest-altitude non-technical ascents. Still, its considerable elevation means it&rsquo;s no easy feat, and only an estimated 30% of climbers who attempt to reach the summit are successful. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/media/upload/rahul/2021/03/20/mount-aconcagua-4.jpg\" style=\"height:286px; width:500px\" /></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\"><em><span style=\"background-color:white\"><strong>How long does it take?</strong></span></em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\"><span style=\"background-color:white\">Climbing Aconcagua takes approximately 3 weeks, a little less if you&rsquo;re pre acclimatized.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\"><em><span style=\"background-color:white\"><strong>Range/Grading, Difficulty level</strong></span></em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\"><span style=\"background-color:white\">Andes/1A , 7/10</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\"><em><span style=\"background-color:white\"><strong>How hard is it?</strong></span></em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\"><span style=\"background-color:white\">7/10.

The national park officials maintain strict rules thus requiring local guides to accompany each team.

It&rsquo;s a dormant volcano among the most prominent summits in the world, rising dramatically from the landscape around it. Mt. Elbrus has two main summits &ndash; the western summit at 18,513&rsquo;/5642m and the eastern summit at 18,442&rsquo;/5621m.The first ascent of the west peak was in 1829 by a Russian army team and the east in 1874 by an English team. Mont Blanc is sometimes consider the highest in Europe but Elbrus technically holds that honor.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\"><span style=\"background-color:white\">It can be climbed from the north or south with the north being significantly less crowded and more difficult. The standard south route on Elbrus is technically easy. The north side has&nbsp;a longer, more complicated approach and is considered more of a climbing experience than the south. These days, most climbers take the technically easy &quot;Normal Route,&quot; which still presents some serious challenges: not only is it at high altitude, but the weather here is notoriously unpredictable and a storm could come up very suddenly.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\"><span style=\"background-color:white\">As with most mountains that have a reputation for being easy, they are also deadly and Elbrus is no exception.

The climb itself is a series of long snow slopes not requiring significant technical skills or gear however it is harsh with the weather and loads over 50 lbs split between a pack and a sled. Once you summit, if you summit, you might be stuck for more weeks waiting for the big IIyushin to return!

            "content": "<p><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#262626\">We all yearn to be in the mountains, living in the clouds, but what about climbing to the top of these mountains? Here are a few things I have realized that climbing mountains can help in making a positive difference in life.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color:white\"><strong><span style=\"color:#262626\">No.1: The physical health and fitness benefits are huge.</span></strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#262626\">Not only will you built incredible strength and endurance from climbing mountains (consistently), you will also find that your diet becomes better. All of those fast foods are not readily available in the alpine (thank goodness for that!) so you find that you will have to pack lunches and snacks.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou are also going to find that unhealthy food will not fuel you properly. The work involved in hiking and climbing demands a proper diet. The altitude trains your lungs to become stronger and the struggle becomes less and less every time you hike. Plus there&#39;s a lot to learn from exercising in nature.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/media/upload/Kunal/2021/03/31/1.jpg\" style=\"height:849px; width:720px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color:white\"><strong><span style=\"color:#262626\">No.2:&nbsp; You can see places very few get to see.</span></strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#262626\">We all can see pictures of these places and we all can long to go to these places but actually doing the work to get to these places cuts many out of the crowd. The time and effort required to climb a mountain, and I&rsquo;m talking a good high altitude daylong trek of a mountain, can be too much of a task for many.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen you do make it to the peak you can be rest assured that you are of the few who make it up there and can revel in the beauty and rarity of such a view. The good thing is you&rsquo;re 100% guaranteed to get an amazing view from the top of a mountain (unless it&rsquo;s a foggy day or smoky day).</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#262626\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/media/upload/Kunal/2021/03/31/3.jpg\" style=\"height:480px; width:720px\" /></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>No.3: You will meet the most amazing people, who you will call friends</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hikers and Climbers are an awesome breed of people. You will find these a few similarities between them: They are all positive, they are all strong , confident, shearing same objectives and they are all happy. Meeting people through alpine clubs, hiking groups and social media will be some of the main ways to find hiking partners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The great thing about hiking people is that we all have the similar goals, to get to the top of the mountain and to enjoy a day of exercise and nature&rsquo;s beauty. Lifelong friends can be made this way because you generally spend a lot of time with each other. You also get to take in the most beautiful places with these people, which can bring people together in special ways.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/media/upload/Kunal/2021/03/31/4.jpg\" style=\"height:720px; width:720px\" /><br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>NO. 4: You will finally understand why the mountains are calling and you must go</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mountains are so special; they have such magic in them. Maybe it is because of the fact they are so fascinating or maybe it is because they make us feel so small. Even if you don&rsquo;t climb them, they seem to call you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You might find that all the problems in your life dissolve when you are around them or that life slows down a bit. All that I can tell you is that after spending time surrounded them or climbing, you will feel the urge to come back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/media/upload/Kunal/2021/03/31/5.jpg\" style=\"height:720px; width:720px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>NO. 5: Climbing Mountains will teach you patience, persistence and gratitude</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Climbing a mountain is the farthest thing from easy. Long stretches of constant vertical climbing can be the most exhausting and hardest thing you may have done. Not only the physical difficulties but also the mental difficulties will also test you.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nExposed and tricky climbing and route finding can get the best of your mental abilities. The classic quote that tells you &ldquo;not to look at the whole mountain take it one piece at a time&rdquo; is something you will come to understand. You will learn to never give up; to know that the reward will be worth the work it takes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt may take you several months, attempts and hours but you will take the time and you can achieve the climb. Once you make it you will realize what all the fuss is about. It is like reaching a goal, achieving a dream and figuring out that you can do anything that you set your mind to. It&rsquo;s an addictive feeling that no one can properly explain and one that you have to experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/media/upload/Kunal/2021/03/31/6.jpg\" style=\"height:877px; width:720px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>NO. 6: They will make you realise why we want to protect the environment</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>After watching what untouched places look like you will want to protect them for future generations. Clear cutting and human interference in any of these beautiful places will be the worst thing imaginable. You might finally understand why there are so many rules in national parks and that you are so thankful for these rules.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBeautiful places can become hotspots for people and their protection is best to let everyone enjoy these places. After climbing mountains you respect what we have a little more. I find I recycle more, use less and reuse items to help in any way possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/media/upload/Kunal/2021/03/31/7.jpg\" style=\"height:469px; width:720px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>NO. 7: They will teach you how to be positive</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have negative thoughts about climbing a mountain it is probably your one‑way ticket to failure. Telling yourself you can&rsquo;t or that it is impossible don&rsquo;t help in any way. If you are positive, even if the climb is impossible at the moment, you will continue to try.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI always tell myself I must have 120% determination to achieve this climb. If you don&rsquo;t believe you can climb the mountain than you probably never will. You can do more than you think you can and you just have to trust yourself, believe in yourself and take it one bit at a time, before you know it you will be standing on the peak.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/media/upload/Kunal/2021/03/31/8.jpg\" style=\"height:515px; width:720px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>NO. 8: They will teach you to enjoy the small luxuries in life</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A grueling six hours of vertical in the heat and you stop for water break. It will probably be the best water you have ever tasted in your life. We overlook the small things in life that we take for granted, like water.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen you reach the peak but forget to bring your extra coat you will realize how cold the wind can make you and how important the little things are when they are not there. We learn to become more prepared and to respect comfortable things, like not sleeping on hard rocks in the cold for instance.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/media/upload/Kunal/2021/03/31/9.jpg\" style=\"height:559px; width:720px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>NO. 9: They will teach you about change and being prepared for change</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have ever spent time in the mountains you should know that the weather changes in a heartbeat so being prepared is key. Every mountain is different so most of the time you also will have to change your route.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere is never just one way up a mountain, sometimes the route can be taken is many other ways when something is blocking your way. Mountains will teach you that things are always changing and you just need to find another tactic to overcome the change.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/media/upload/Kunal/2021/03/31/10.jpg\" style=\"height:719px; width:720px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>NO. 10: They will teach you that every Season is Beautiful</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mountains are majestic in every season. One can appreciate to climb the mountains at different time of the year according to level of uncertainty, unpredictability and difficulty.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEach and every season comes with different challenges and benefits and these help us to become a better climber.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/media/upload/Kunal/2021/03/31/11.jpg\" style=\"height:511px; width:720px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>NO. 11: Every Mountain will teach you something</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I always find that every mountain I have climbed has taught me at least one important lesson. On a rainy climb, I learnt that cameras are not waterproof! Another climb taught me to be better prepared at finding the route (more research etc). Whether they teach you to bring a bivouac in case you have to sleep overnight or teach you that proper shoes are essential, you always learn something every time.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMountain climbing can be the greatest and the worst thing you ever do in life but in the end of it all, you usually end up wanting more of it no matter what.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/media/upload/Kunal/2021/03/31/12.jpg\" style=\"height:491px; width:720px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>NO. 12: Last but not the least, for everyone, the quick Mountain Lessons</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whether you are driving through the hills or hiking up a mountain, the journey is more important than the destination (Isn&rsquo;t this true for life as well?). I did a much‑hyped trek at the beginning of this year and expected something surreal at the endpoint. While the trail was breathtaking, the endpoint was a placid lake surrounded by mountain on three sides that seemed only okay, esp. when compared to the entire trail.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI had read about this concept of the journey being more important than the destination, but mountains surmised it the best for me. The intention of telling this was how mountains are great teachers, demanding nothing but a visit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/media/upload/Kunal/2021/03/31/13.jpg\" style=\"height:540px; width:720px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:black\">Come !

Roberts and Sen Tenzing in May 1953, by following now the same standard route from the Mera La. The ascent to Mera using the standard route from Mera La is technically straightforward, although it requires the crossing of high and difficult passes, can be long and demanding, especially in the event of a heavy snow fall and open maze of crevasses.\r\nWe usually recommend Mera Peak to experienced high altitude trekkers who would like to branch into mountain climbing. If you have done some climbing at high altitude, then Mera Peak will be a brilliant choice. As the climb is not very technical, the true challenge with this mountain is that it will test your stamina and endurance.\r\nThe trek starts with a beautiful approach away from the crowds on the Everest trek.  You trek past remote villages and terrace farms growing rice for the first couple of days, before crossing into the Makalu Barun National Park.  The trek then leads you to the village of Khare which is situated at the snow line, an important point to restock supplies before heading to the Mera Peak Base Camp.  After a long gruelling climb from the High Camp, a gentle slope leads you up to the summit.  The views from both, the high camp, and from the summit are breath-taking, with clear visibility of some the biggest mountains in the world - Everest, Lhotse, Makalu and Baruntse\r\nThe trek nights are usually spent in basic Tea House lodges while the nights of the final climb are spent in fully supported camping with all meals provided.",

This trek is considered as an alternative trek route for Annapurna circuit trekking as the trek encompasses all of the elements of a classic Nepal trekking experience of villages, wildlife, panoramic mountain views, and a range of landscape from forest to high alpine.\r\nMardi Himal at the east of Annapurna under the impressive Machhapuchre is the lowest, the least climbed and visited peak in Nepal. Trekking around its base camp is a shorter trek making it great for first-timers and more experienced trekkers, as it takes around the least explored trail much away from the crowd of trekkers through the south of Annapurna then towards Mardi Himal (5,587m), a prominent peak lying directly under the inspiring summit of Machhapuchare and directly opposite the massive south face of Annapurna 1.\r\nTrekkers visiting Mardi Himal trekking can experience Himalayan ranges, mountain landscapes, natural hot springs, mixed indigenous lifestyle, rhododendron forest, alpine meadows, an abundance of wildlife,  ancient caves, waterfalls, various species of flora and fauna- truly wilderness experience.",

Elbrus is not technically difficult but usually requires crampons and sometimes ice-axes. No previous experience or climbing skills are required which makes it an ideal trip for climbers aiming to build their altitude experience while climbing one of the Seven Summits!\\r\\nWe begin our adventure in Moscow and going ahead slowly slowly. Our itinerary is well thought out as we have ample time for acclimatization and weather delays. The summit provides amazing views of the Caucus mountain range. This is an excellent peak to train on if you are intending to climb in the Himalaya or Alaska ranges.",

            "about": "Kilimanjaro, the “roof” of Africa, is located in Tanzania. The highest mountain and dormant volcano in the continent of Africa. At a staggering height of 5895m, climbing Kilimanjaro gives a unique wilderness experience as you ascend to the tallest free-standing mountain on earth. Gradual ascend of Kilimanjaro offers the chance to marvel its view and unique vegetation.\\r\\nThe mountain rises from a vast expanse of dry savannah while its lower slopes are dense with lush forest.  Despite this dormant volcano being near the Equator, the caldera is covered with ice. There is no doubt that the views from its top are the greatest reward of all. From the summit of Kilimanjaro peak, you can even observe the curvature of the planet. On a clear day, the views stretch as far as the plains of the Masai-Mara, in Kenya.\\r\\nThe Mount Kilimanjaro trek has much more to offer than its awe-inspiring views. Embarking on an expedition to the roof of Africa is like travelling from the Equator to the Arctic. The landscape varies from bush-land to tropical forest; from moorland to heath and alpine desert.\\r\\nWith our experience of high altitude trekking, we strongly recommend the Machame Route for your Kilimanjaro Trek.  This route climbs through the beautiful rain forest and takes you up tothe barren landscape of the Shira plateau.  The Kilimanjaro trek route then leads you around the southern slope of the Barranco gorge, up the Barafu high camp, to reach the summit at Uhuru Peak. Machame route allows you to acclimatize better to the sudden increase in altitude.  It also increases your chances of reaching the Kilimanjaro summit.  With our help, you will soon be standing on the top of the Africa, Uhuru Peak.",

            "about": "Hiking in the Himalayas is not always about climbing high peaks or reaching to the high passes it about witnessing every element of the mountains. Ali Bedni offers you the biggest meadows (bugyal) landscape of India and the never-ending eye-soothing greenery. As you might have guessed from the name is an epitome of meadows with stupendous Himalayan peaks standing tall in the background. The hike is a pleasant walk through the grasslands with cattle grazing, birds chirping and tiny flowers magnifying the elegance. \r\nThe best part of the experience is the moment when you get out of the shades of the forest cover, and see acres and acres of green carpet of Ali meadows sprawled out in front of you. Mt Trishul, stands tall against the blue skies, making for a formidable backdrop. Horses and their foals tear themselves across the turf in an uninhibited abandon while the cattle graze lazily on this bounty. Oh what a treat that is!\r\n Your first glimpse of Mt. Trishul is the backdrop to sprawling Ali Bugyal when you enter it. The mountain becomes even more imposing in Bedni, standing like a sentient guard to the meadow along with Mt Nanda Ghunti. \r\n The Bedni Bugyal is another stop in this meadow country – a strip of vibrant green, overlooking the western valley. Popping right out of this meadow like sentient, silent guards are the mountains of Trishul and Nanda Ghunti. If you climb the Bedni Top, other high risers of the imposing Chaukhamba range open up before you. \r\n On this experience, you will find dense oak and rhododendron forests of Ghairoli Patal along with walnut, pear, Himalayan roses and other flora. You may even spot birds like a flycatcher, and magpies. The evening light on these trees and Mt Trishul that peeks at you from the horizon is picture-perfect. These incredible settings make these twin meadow mighty and must do adventure.",

The upper part of the river Ganga is also called Bhagirathi, and both the mountain and the river are named after King Bhagirath. \r\n\r\nThe peak rises to a height of 6513M right above the Gangotri glacier and the river Bhagirathi which later forms Ganga emerging from Gaumukh. Mt. Bhagirathi 2 is the most popular among its sister peaks of Bhagirathi 1 (6856M) and Bhagirathi 3 (6454M) owing to its less technical approach to climbing. \r\n\r\nGifted with mesmerizing views of the famed peaks of Thalaysagar, Shivling and Meru, the Bhagirathi 2 peak climb is not for the faint hearted. Significant prior trekking experience along with previous mountaineering experience of 6000M+ peaks is a must to undertake this challenging yet glorious expedition. Meant only for experienced trekkers aspiring to climb 7000M+ peaks in the future, the Bhagirathi 2 expedition will require the use of ropes, crampons and ice axes. The summit gives you unimaginable views of the entire Gangotri region and trekkers from all over the world undertake this expedition to fulfill their dreams of conquering one of the most beautiful peaks of the Garhwal Himalayas.

The massif has three peaks namely Bandarpunch I (6316 M), Bandarpunch 2 (6102 M) and Kalanag (Black Peak - 6387 M). Bandarpunch 1 peak is ideal for those looking to prepare for expeditions of peaks climbing to 7000M+. However, not be too technical the Bandarpoonch peak expedition must be attempted by only those who have previous trekking experience and ample knowledge on mountaineering techniques along with the use of technical equipment like rope-up procedures, jumar and crampons. \r\n\r\nThe expedition has its fair share of challenges such as a heavily crevasse infested route to the summit and unpredictable weather conditions. Acclimatization to the high altitudes of the peak is imperative. The summit offers magnificent views of the surrounding peaks like Kalanag, Swargarohini, Satopanth, Sudarshan Parvat, Jogin, Gangotri range and many more.

Kedar dome is relatively easy peak to climb which is just about 170m short of 7000m mark, but would require past climbing experience and ability to survive in high altitude Himalayan weather. It is a magnificent marvel of nature and holds sentimental values to Hindus - as the peaks name itself is that of Lord Shiva.\r\n\r\nIt was first climbed in 1947 by a Swiss Team which also climbed Mt. Kedarnath nearby. The Northwest flank taken during the first ascent is still the standard route to climb this mountain. This is a great mountain for people looking to climb something really high but not requiring serious mountaineering skills. It forms a great stepping stone to climb 7000m plus mountains. It is also popular for ski-mountaineering trips.",

We would be climbing the peak through the West Ridge. A cluster of major peaks such as Mt. Saifee, Mt. Thelu, Mt. Koteshwar, Mt. Swetwarn, Chaturbhuj etc. surround Sudarshan Parbat. Setting the base camp at the Raktavarn glacier, we would be putting up three more camps before the final assault on the summit. \r\n\r\nThe major glaciers that describe the Gangotri region are the Gangotri, Chaturangi and Raktavarn, which lie adjacent to each other. At Gaumukh (Cow`s Mouth), the source of the holy Ganges can be observed that is emerging from the depths of the glacier, and the shape of the ice formation is indeed like a cow`s mouth. Immediately opposite of the Gaumukh is Shivling (6543 metres), a towering pinnacle of rare beauty and of equally severe technical difficulty.",

The journey en route Kalindi Khal unfolds views of some of the highest and most majestic peaks of the Indian Himalayan range - Shivling at 6,543 m, Meru at 6,630 m, Kedar Dome at 6,808 m, Bhagirathi group at 6,856 m, Nilkantha at 6,506 m, Chandra Parvat at 6,728 m, Avalanche Peak at 6,413 m, Kamet at 7,756 m Mana at 7,272 m and Abi Gamin at 7,355 m. Although prior climbing experience is not required, this trip is one of our most demanding treks suited to only those who want to join a reconnaissance style expedition.",

Mostly it is required at the campsite or n the summit days when one starts a day early in the morning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rain Jacket &amp; Pants - Mandatory for the outdoor experience. A Poncho with sleeves would also work. It is always better to have a Rain Jacket than wish you had one!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Woollen gloves - 2 pairs. As thick as available in the market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nylon hiking shorts - Nylon is preferred over cotton as it dries faster. Or you can choose to hike in trek pants (which has multiple pockets). Remember these are heavier than shorts, and being cotton, do not offer any warmth! So keep one hiking shorts and one trek pant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Underwear - 2-3 changes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sun hat - Cotton or nylon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sunglasses - Preferably with a retainer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sun protection lotion - We would recommend a lotion that has a rating of SPF-5 at least.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lip balm - This is a highly recommended item.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cup, bowl &amp; spoon - Preferably made of sturdy plastic. Steel will be fine. Remember it is heavierthan plastic. Also, for multiple reasons we recommend a bowl to eat out of rather than a plate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Water bottle: &nbsp;2 of 1 liter capacity each. Please ensure that they do not leak.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Headlamp/ flashlight - Preferably a headlamp as it leaves your hands free to do other work. Please bring extra batteries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"

The physical fitness required for the Lobuche Peak climb can be obtained by training around 2-3 months in advance depending on your current fitness level. A high amount of cardiovascular endurance would be required and sports like running,swimming and cycling can help build that endurance. Walking up flights of stairs with a loaded backpack helps to get your muscles used to the rucksack you will be carrying.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For complete beginners, basic technical knowledge is required for this climb, and so, we have allotted one entire day at Lobuche Peak Base camp where your guide will teach you the basics of using equipment such as ice axes, jumars, ascenders, descenders, crampons, and the basics of ice climbing. However, if you have access to a rock-climbing wall where you can learn how to use technical equipment, you can add that to your training plan.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>WE RECOMMEND THE FOLLOWING SCHEDULE TO THE PARTICIPANTS</strong>&nbsp;</h4>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>WEEK ONE/TWO:</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Participants should develop the habit of being able to get up in the morning and run / brisk walk&nbsp;for a minimum of 5-6 km at least 4-5 days a week. This would represent 20-25 minutes of cardio exercise. Though difficult at first, keep at it. You can stop and take breaks as well.&nbsp; During the day, you should get into the habit of avoiding elevators and taking the steps. You should be able to climb at least 4/5 flights of steps daily. (avoid going down steps too fast as this could result in some knee injuries). If you don&rsquo;t enjoy running and are into some other sport like cycling or swimming, spend about 45 mins cycling or about 600 &ndash; 800 mts of swimming for at least 4 days a week. This is the perfect base for the fitness required for island peak.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>WEEK THREE/FOUR:</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Assuming you have successfully survived week one and are consistent with your exercise, you can take up the pace a notch. Increase your distance to 6/7 kms per day and 5 times a week, you can additionally go to a gym.&nbsp; Avoid heavy weight training.&nbsp; Focus more on a core workout. These are the muscle groups that run along the length of your body and helps maintain your posture and sustains you during your long hours of working.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>WEEK FIVE/SIX:</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>In addition to the week two exercise, one additional feature you should add in week three is walking for half an hour during the evenings with a backpack on carrying 6-7 kgs. This could be 2lts of water, some snacks, a jacket etc. This will help strengthen your back and shoulders thus preparing you for the long hours of trekking. If you don&rsquo;t want to just simply walk, also try increasing your time on climbing flight of steps. As compared to week one, you should aim to be able to climb 10-12 flight of stairs comfortably.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>WEEK SEVEN/EIGHT:</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Maintenance- Keep up the tempo, sustain the workout. Try avoiding doing anything very rigorous but be consistent with morning and evening walks/runs and climbing flight of stairs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>WEEK NINE:</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Sustain the workout. Increase only if you feel comfortable.&nbsp; Start doing an additional 25-30 mins of climbing stairs in the morning/evening with a daypack of 6-7 kg; about 30-35 floors once a day should help increase the stamina and endurance considerably.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Please remember, consistency is the key here. Do not do anything to exert yourself or something that will increase chances of injury. Running / brisk walking 4-5 kms for 5 days in a week is far better than running a 20 km on one day of the week and injuring your knee/ligaments in the process.

            "manual": "<p>Climbing Mount Kilimanjaro is a physical undertaking, so you should prepare yourself accordingly with a good 3 - 4 months training program. Being in good shape is important in many respects. Obviously, strong, conditioned legs make it easier to walk uphill and downhill for sustained periods of time. General aerobic fitness allows the body to function efficiently with less oxygen. And a fit body is more likely to withstand the stress of consecutive days of hiking and camping. Finally, a positive mental attitude can work wonders for you when fatigue and doubts arise. How hard is it to climb Kilimanjaro? That&#39;s a difficult question to answer because some people don&#39;t train much and fare very well, while others engage in a disciplined training program and succumb to the altitude in a few days. We&#39;ve heard marathon runners tell us that climbing Kilimanjaro is the hardest thing they&#39;ve ever done. The best advice we can give you is to train adequately, as described below, and get yourself in the best possible hiking shape.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>We recommend the following schedule to the participants.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>WEEK ONE/TWO:</strong>&nbsp;The participants should develop the habit of being able to get up in the morning and run/brisk walk&nbsp;for a minimum of 3-4 Km atleast 4-5 days a week.

You should start with shorter time intervals, a slower pace, and no weight (in your day pack) and then gradually increase all of the above as your fitness level improves. Remember that on Mount Kilimanjaro, you will walk slowly for prolonged periods and carry probably no more than 2-3nkgs in your day pack. Therefore, in your training, it is better to increase the time interval/distance and keep a slow pace than to shorten the time interval/distance and increase the pace. Try to train three times a week, for at least one hour per session, at a minimum. Please remember, Consistency is the Key here. Do not do anything to exert yourself or something that will increase chances of Injury. Running / brisk walking 4-5 kms for 5 days in a week is far better than running a 20 km on one day of the week and injuring your Knee / Ligaments in the process . If you can be consistent with above mentioned schedule, The Kilimanjaro climb though physically challenging, will become a pleasant and enjoyable experience for you.

Good cardio-vascular conditioning and exercises for muscles that are used to hiking will make your trip much more enjoyable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We recommend the following schedule to the participants:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Week One:</strong> Participants should develop a habit of being able to get up in the morning and run / brisk walk for a minimum of 3-4 Km at least 3-4 days a week. This would represent at least 20-25 minutes of cardio exercise. Though difficult at first, keep at it. You can stop and take breaks as well. During the day, you should get into the habit of avoiding elevators and taking the steps. You should be able to climb at least 4/5 flights of steps daily. (Avoid going down steps too fast as this could result in some knee injuries). If you Don&rsquo;t enjoy running and are into some other sport like cycling or swimming, spend about 30-45 mins cycling or about 600 &ndash; 800 mts of swimming for at least 4 days a week. You can make a mixed schedule and try to follow it for first week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Week Two:</strong> Assuming you have successfully survived week one and are consistent with your exercise, you can take up the pace a notch. Increase your distance to 5/6 kms per day and 5 times a week, you can additionally go to a gym. Avoid heavy weight training. Focus more on a core workout. These are your muscle groups that run along the length of your body and helps maintain your posture and sustains you during your long hours of working. Make a combination of exercises with running and try to follow it for second week of prepration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Week Three:</strong> In addition to the week Two exercise, one additional feature you should add in Week Three is walking for half an hour during the evenings with a backpack on carrying 3-4 kgs. This could be 2lts of water, some snacks, a jacket etc. This will help strengthen your back and shoulders thus preparing you for the long hours of trekking. If you don&rsquo;t want to just simply walk, also try increasing your time on climbing flight of steps. As compared to week One, you should aim to be able to climb 10-12 flight of stairs comfortably.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Week Four:</strong> Sustenance. Keep up the tempo, sustain the workout. Try avoiding doing anything very rigorous but be consistent with morning and evening walks / runs and climbing flight of stairs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Week Five:</strong> Sustain the workout. Increase only if you feel comfortable. Start doing an additional 10- 15 mins of climbing stairs in the morning / evening with a daypack of 2-3 kg; about 20-25 floors once a day should help increase the stamina and Endurance considerably.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Moniter your growth with our Expert.</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Contact: info@uforangers.com</em></strong></p>"

If you don&rsquo;t enjoy running and are into some other sport like cycling or swimming, spend about 45 mins cycling or about 600 &ndash; 800 mts of swimming for at least 4 days a week. This is the perfect base for the fitness required for island peak.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:black\">WEEK THREE/FOUR:</span></strong>&nbsp;<span style=\"color:black\">Assuming you have successfully survived week one and are consistent with your exercise, you can take up the pace a notch. Increase your distance to 6/7 kms per day and 5 times a week, you can additionally go to a gym.&nbsp; Avoid heavy weight training.&nbsp; Focus more on a core workout. These are the muscle groups that run along the length of your body and helps maintain your posture and sustains you during your long hours of working.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:black\">WEEK FIVE/SIX:</span></strong>&nbsp;<span style=\"color:black\">In addition to the week two exercise, one additional feature you should add in week three is walking for half an hour during the evenings with a backpack on carrying 6-7 kgs. This could be 2lts of water, some snacks, a jacket etc. This will help strengthen your back and shoulders thus preparing you for the long hours of trekking. If you don&rsquo;t want to just simply walk, also try increasing your time on climbing flight of steps. As compared to week one, you should aim to be able to climb 10-12 flight of stairs comfortably.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:black\">WEEK SEVEN/EIGHT:</span></strong>&nbsp;<span style=\"color:black\">Maintenance- Keep up the tempo, sustain the workout. Try avoiding doing anything very rigorous but be consistent with morning and evening walks/runs and climbing flight of stairs.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:black\">WEEK NINE:</span></strong>&nbsp;<span style=\"color:black\">Sustain the workout. Increase only if you feel comfortable.&nbsp; Start doing an additional 25-30 mins of climbing stairs in the morning/evening with a daypack of 6-7 kg; about 30-35 floors once a day should help increase the stamina and endurance considerably.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Please remember, consistency is the key here. Do not do anything to exert yourself or something that will increase chances of injury. Running / brisk walking 4-5 kms for 5 days in a week is far better than running a 20 km on one day of the week and injuring your knee/ligaments in the process. If you can be consistent with above mentioned schedule, the Nun climb though physically challenging, will become a pleasant and enjoyable experience for you.

Its rich artistic and cultural heritage is evident where ornately carved balconies mingle with beautiful shrines and temples. If you arrive early, why not check out Durbar Square with its temples, markets and busy atmosphere. It is also worth the climb to visit the Swayambhunath &ndash; the &#39;monkey temple&#39;. Explore the network of street markets and alley bazaars and Pashupatinath. For those with a few extra days in Kathmandu, the neighbouring towns of Patan and Bhaktapur are also well worth a visit.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">In the evening we can enjoy a welcome dinner hosted by our team.

Welcome to Nepal. Our journey in Nepal begins today. Our trek representative will be waiting for us at the airport. He/she will then drop us off at our hotel where we can take a rest. Kathmandu, the colourful capital of Nepal, is a fascinating blend of traditional architecture and symbols of the 20th century. Its rich artistic and cultural heritage is evident where ornately carved balconies mingle with beautiful shrines and temples. If you arrive early, why not check out Durbar Square with its temples, markets and busy atmosphere. It is also worth the climb to visit the Swayambhunath &ndash; the &#39;monkey temple&#39;. Explore the network of street markets and alley bazaars and Pashupatinath. For those with a few extra days in Kathmandu, the neighbouring towns of Patan and Bhaktapur are also well worth a visit.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">In the evening we can enjoy a welcome dinner hosted by our team.

The journey begins by crossing a bridge, before you trek through a forest, then climb onto a ridge above the wild rapids of Budhi Gandaki River (which is joined from the Tum Khola River in the Tibetan highlands). </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#243f60\"><span style=\"color:black\">You&#39;ll then reach Khursane on a rocky trail, past two tropical waterfalls on a steep, rocky trail clinging to the side of a cliff.

The valley widens a bit as the trail continues to the Ghatta Khola river. You&#39;ll continue walking upstream to a long suspension bridge in Philim, a large Gurung village. From here, the trail turns north just above the lowest house in the village and stays on a fairly level trail as it crosses millet fields to Ekle Bhatti. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The route now enters a steep, uninhabited gorge where you&#39;ll descend to the grassy slopes, and then cross the Budhi Gandaki river.

First, cross the Budhi Gandaki river and climb up to the bridge, where you&#39;ll climb a bit further to join a trail from Bhi. Then head west up the valley passing through lush forests, alpine vegetation, and quaint villages housing ethnic groups of the Manaslu region, with major peaks starting to appear in the distance</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Even though there is another route, you will take the trail through Prok. This village has a beautiful vantage point of the snowcapped Siringi Himal. Take a break here and then continue to cross the Budi Gandaki several times today running into several gompas along the way. The trail then follows the river upstream through a dense forest and leads to a narrow gorge. Keep going until you notice the forest becomes less dense. This rewarding part of the walk is a magnificent way to experience the Manaslu Conservation Area. You&#39;ll eventually reach one last steep climb to get you to the village of Namrung. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Trek Distance: 19.5km/12.1 miles</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Trek Duration: 6-7 hrs </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Highest Altitude: 2,630m/ 8,626 feet</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Accommodation: Tea House</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Meals Included: (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner)</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:black\">Day 07: Trek from Namrung to Samagaon (3,530m/</span></strong> <strong><span style=\"color:black\">11,578 feet)</span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">After breakfast in Namrung, you can walk around the village for a good viewpoint of Siring, Ganesh Himal, and also Mount Himal Chuli to the south.

Upon arrival at the High Camp, we are rewarded by an excellent panoramic views of Everest, Makalu and the Nuptse, Lhotse wall directly ahead. The setting sun casts an unbelievably magic light on these awesome mountains. We can also see the most of the route to the summit. We get an early night in to prepare for tomorrow&#39;s summit bid.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Trek Duration: 3-4 hrs </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#243f60\"><span style=\"color:black\">Highest Altitude: 5750m/18864ft</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#243f60\"><span style=\"color:black\">Accommodation: </span><span style=\"color:black\">Tent</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#243f60\"><span style=\"color:black\">Meals Included: (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner)</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:black\">Day 13: Summit Mera Peak (6654 m) and trek back to Khare. </span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">We wake up early with hot cups of tea and start heading out into the cold on our way to the summit of Mera Peak. The going is relatively straight forward as we make our way up the Mera glacier and set a slow, steady pace. The route is still non-technical as we climb slowly but surely higher into the ever-thinning air. From the high camp the summit bid will be made early in the morning, and take around 4 to 6 hours to get to the summit. The first rays of the sun hit the big peaks in an amazing red glow. At the foot of the final steep summit cone, we may attach to a fixed rope depending on conditions. The summit is only a few meters away. Shortly ahead is that moment we have all been working so hard to achieve: the summit itself. The slope steepens for a section behind the ridge and the summit comes back into view. The 360 panorama is perhaps one of the most impressive as well as incredible views of Baruntse (7129m), Haling (7319m) and NauLekh (6360m) with Makalu (8481m) looming behind. We are far enough back so that the smaller peaks do not obscure the views, but at the same time are deep in the heart of this fantastic mountainous vista. We spend some time taking it all in before we finally descend back down to Khare for our overnight at lodge which is about 2 hours descent. This is a very long but satisfying day.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Trek Duration: 9-10 hrs </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#243f60\"><span style=\"color:black\">Highest Altitude: 6654m/21831ft</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#243f60\"><span style=\"color:black\">Accommodation: </span><span style=\"color:black\">Tea House </span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#243f60\"><span style=\"color:black\">Meals Included: (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner)</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:black\">Day 14: Buffer Day</span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">We have allocated an extra day as a spare day or contingency day, set aside in case of problems with the weather or acclimatization. This extra day definitely gives some flexibility and use for a second summit attempt. This is also a buffer day in case of any other delays experienced along the way such as Lukla flight. If everything has gone smoothly and you succeed to climb at the summit day, this day is used to covering for next day trek. If this day is not to utilize, as a contingency day, then it will use as a free day in Kathmandu.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#243f60\"><span style=\"color:black\">Accommodation: </span><span style=\"color:black\">Tent</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#243f60\"><span style=\"color:black\">Meals Included: (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner)</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:black\">Day 15: Kongma Dingma to Seto Pokhara via Honku Valley (5035m)</span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">After a successful expedition to Mera peak, we walk today through the remote valley of the upper yak pastures of this.

There is a famous monastery at Pangboche believed to have been the oldest in the Khumbu region. To reach Pangboche after a few long days of hard mountaineering and trekking is a delight.

Pick up from airport and drive to Cheget District.</span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Fly from Moscow to MineralVody. We usually recommend all our clients to take early morning flight and reach MineralVody by early afternoon, so that we can drive to the Terskol village in the beautiful Baskan valley comfortably. Our group usually leaves the MineralVody by about 2 pm. It&rsquo;s a comfortable 3.5 hrs drive and we reach Terskol by 5.30 pm. We check in the small but cozy mountain hotel and spend the evening resting.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color:white\"><strong><span style=\"color:black\">Day04:&nbsp;Rest day in Cheget. Acclimatization trek to Mt.Cheget. Gear rental and supplies purchase.</span></strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:black\">Today is the acclimatization day. After healthy breakfast, we walk around the village and take a cable car up to the base of the Cheget peak which is approximately 3100 Mts. The Hike is about 2-3 hours depending on the pace of the trekkers. Going up to the Cheget peak is optional and one may choose to just walk around the base of the cable car to acclimatize around the 3000 mts mark. We descend down to the village by lunch time. Post Lunch, the next couple of hours are spent in the rental equipment shop. There are two shops with a range of equipment and depending on the requirement you can rent equipment from the shop. Our guide is there with you to assist you with the same.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color:white\"><strong><span style=\"color:black\">Day05:&nbsp;Drive to Treskol village and cable car to Base Camp &ndash; Barrel Huts.</span></strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:black\">Today is the day when we move up the mountain. We leave the hotel after breakfast. We don&rsquo;t need to carry our entire luggage and can leave some stuff behind in the hotel cloak room. We drive to the Ski Lift station and take the Ski Lifts up to the refugee huts on Mt. Elbrus. We walk a short distance (may be around 15 &ndash; 20 mins) to our mountain refuge which is located roughly around 3600-3800 Mts. We take some time to settle down in the Mountain refuge and then go for a short acclimatization walk on the snow to get used to the conditions. Our aim is to walk around 1-2 hours and go up to an altitude of 4200 Mts. We then descend down to the refuge to spend the night indoors.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color:white\"><strong><span style=\"color:black\">Day06:&nbsp;Acclimatization Day trek to Pushtov rocks.</span></strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:black\">Acclimatization walk to the Pastuckhov rocks. We leave after breakfast and start climbing towards the Pastuckhov rocks located at 4800 Mts. This acclimatization day is important and the walk is about 3-4 hours up and about 2 hours down. We return in time to have a hot lunch at the mountain refuge.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color:white\"><strong><span style=\"color:black\">Day07:&nbsp;Rest day and basic snow craft training.</span></strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:black\">Today&rsquo;s day is for Ice and snow training. We teach you basic techniques of snow craft and Ice craft which will help you on the Summit day. Ice axe arrest, roping up with the team, using crampons, ascending and descending on the snow are some of the techniques are team and guide will teach you. The afternoon and evening is utilized relaxing and sleeping so that one is fresh for the next day&rsquo;s Summit attempt.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color:white\"><strong><span style=\"color:black\">Day08:&nbsp;Push to Summit and descend to Huts. Possibly even descend to Cheget. </span></strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:black\">It&rsquo;s the Summit day. A day we&rsquo;ve all planned and prepared for months now. Depending on the snow conditions, the weather and the walking speed of the group, we leave the refuge by 2am and start climbing up. If the weather is right, we reach the summit in about 6 &ndash; 8 hours and return back to the refuge by 1pm and descend down to the Treskol village by Ski Lifts the same evening. In case the group gets delayed and we are not able to come down to the refuge by 03:00 pm, then we spend the night at the mountain refuge only and descend down to the Treskol village only the next morning. The climbers have an option of taking a snow vehicle (called a snow Ratrak) which can carry upto 10-12 people up to the Pastuckhov rocks which can save upto 3-4 hours. This is optional and usually costs about USD 100 per head.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color:white\"><strong><span style=\"color:black\">Day09:&nbsp;Buffer day for bad weather. Or alternately, descend to Cheget.</span></strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:black\">This day is kept as a reserve buffer day in case of bad weather on the previous day. If because of the weather conditions, the group takes an attempt of reaching the summit on this day, it is necessary to descend to the valley same evening. Overnight at the hotel in Treskol.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color:white\"><strong><span style=\"color:black\">Day10: Cheget to Mineral Vody and fly to Moscow.</span></strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:black\">The Group leaves Treskol village after breakfast and reaches Mineral Vody by 11:00 am or so.

Welcome to Nepal. Our journey in Nepal begins today. Our trek representative will be waiting for us at the airport. He/she will then drop us off at our hotel where we can take a rest. Kathmandu, the colourful capital of Nepal, is a fascinating blend of traditional architecture and symbols of the 20th century. Its rich artistic and cultural heritage is evident where ornately carved balconies mingle with beautiful shrines and temples. If you arrive early, why not check out Durbar Square with its temples, markets and busy atmosphere. It is also worth the climb to visit the Swayambhunath &ndash; the &#39;monkey temple&#39;. Explore the network of street markets and alley bazaars and Pashupatinath. For those with a few extra days in Kathmandu, the neighbouring towns of Patan and Bhaktapur are also well worth a visit.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">In the evening we can enjoy a welcome dinner hosted by our team. During the dinner we can enjoy Nepalese cuisine which will introduce us to the country&rsquo;s food culture. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#243f60\"><span style=\"color:black\">Accommodation: Hotel (1 night)</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#243f60\"><span style=\"color:black\">Meals Included: Dinner </span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:black\">Day 02: Drive from Kathmandu to Arughat then to Soti Khola (730m/2,896ft)</span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">After early morning breakfast, we will begin our journey with a scenic drive to Arughat, following to Soti Khola. Driving on the Prithivi Highway; west from Kathmandu, we will be passing by a beautiful river view of the Trishuli river. In the first few hours, we will reach Dhading Bensi which is the district headquarters of Dhadhing (1050m). In this long drive, we will be stopping for multiple breaks and for lunch as well. From Dhading Bensi, we will be driving to Arughat where the roads will be rough. Along the way, we will see beautiful mountain scenery like Mt. Manaslu and Ganesh Himal range, small villages following the Budhi Gandaki river. Arughat being a large settlement, it is clustered on both sides of Budhi Gandaki river connected by a suspension bridge. The next two hours&rsquo; drive will take us to Soti Khola..</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#243f60\"><span style=\"color:black\">Driving Hours: (160km/99.4 miles) -6-8hrs</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#243f60\"><span style=\"color:black\">Highest Altitude: 730m/2,896ft</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#243f60\"><span style=\"color:black\">Accommodation: </span><span style=\"color:black\">Tea House</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#243f60\"><span style=\"color:black\">Meals Included: (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner)</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:black\">Day 03: &nbsp;Trek from Soti Khola (730m/2,896ft) to Machha Khola (890m/2,965ft)</span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#243f60\"><span style=\"color:black\">We begin our trek to Machha Khola. We will be crossing the Soti Khola with an attractive view of waterfalls and the river. Then we will be walking through the beautiful Sal forest, following the climb onto a ridge above the huge rapids of the Budhi Gandaki river on the way to Liding (750m). Passing through the rocky trails, we reach Khursane. Across Budhi Gandaki are the views of Annapurna Circuit between Bahundanda and Syange that looks incredible. Soon after, we will be trekking down rice terraces taking us to Lapubesi; a Gurung village. The path takes us where the valley opens up and the Budhi Gandaki wanders among wide gravel bars. The trail follows down to the sandy river bed of the Budhi Gandaki and we trek down to Nauli Khola crossing a suspension bridge and eventually arriving at Machha Khola. </span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#243f60\"><span style=\"color:black\">Trek Duration: 6-7 hrs</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#243f60\"><span style=\"color:black\">Highest Altitude: 890m/2,965ft</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#243f60\"><span style=\"color:black\">Accommodation: </span><span style=\"color:black\">Tea House</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#243f60\"><span style=\"color:black\">Meals Included: (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner)</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\"><strong>Day 04: Trek from Machha Khola (890m/2,965ft) to Jagat (1,400m/4,593ft) </strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">After an early morning breakfast, we will trek through a fertile landscape as there will be a few ups and downs. Crossing the Tharo Khola, we will reach Khorlabesi. We slowly begin to gain elevation. As we trek, we pass through a natural hot spring at Tatopani meaning &lsquo;hot water&rsquo; in Nepali. Continuing the trek, we walk through the valley as it gets narrower but nature&rsquo;s beauty does not cease to fail us in the attractiveness. We climb over a ridge, then we cross the Budhi Gandaki river via a suspension bridge. Witnessing picturesque villages, we climb on a wide well designed staircase across a landslide then over a ridge that takes us to Doban. As we ascend up to the Budhi Ganadaki river, we arrive at Yaru Khola that takes us further to a stone staircase with prayer flags hung on the way. We climb more stairs to Tharo Bharyang. Along the route, we pass through paved stones along with mani walls and high overlooks over rivers. Then we reach the appealing village of Jagat that lies on the west side of Budhi Gandaki River.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Trek Duration: 6-7 hrs</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Highest Altitude: 1,400m/4,593ft</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Accommodation: Accommodation: </span><span style=\"color:black\">Tea House/Tents </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Meals Included: (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner)</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\"><strong>Day 05: Trek from Jagat (1,400m/4,593ft) to Lokpa (2,040m/6,692ft) </strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Before heading to Lokpa, we will register our permits for Manaslu and Tsum valley at the entry checkpoint. Climbing a ridge over Gallery, we will walk along the river bank crossing the Budhi Gandaki river via a long wide suspension bridge. Continuing to trek, the valley opens up as we head towards Phillip. The trek throughout is a very pleasant one. We will pass by Ekle Bhatti where the trail separates between Tsum and Manaslu. As we trek, we will notice the welcome board, so we head towards Lokpa. On the way, we will see a few villages and rivers. The rivers begin to narrow down as we meet the convergence of the Syar river from the Tsum valley. Taking a right turn, the trail takes us forward, eventually reaching the Lokpa village. This village is the first village in the Tsum valley that gives us the opportunity to view the beautiful Manaslu range. This village is isolated and is a hidden valley of happiness blessed by Padmashamva centuries ago.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Trek Duration: 6-7 hrs </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Highest Altitude: 2,040m/6,692ft</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Accommodation: </span><span style=\"color:black\">Tea House/Tents </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Meals Included: (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner)</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:black\">Day 06: Trek from Lokpa (2,040m/6,692ft) to Chumling (2,386m/7,828ft)</span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The day begins with a trek from Lokpa village which is an entrance to a wild route to Tsum Valley. Although the actual entrance begins from a deep slender and narrow gorge. Depending on the weather, if favorable, on the way we will be blessed by the amazing view of the Boudha Himal (6,672m) and Ganesh Himal. The route takes us descending down to the Lungwa river valley as we climb through the dense tropical forests of rhododendron, juniper, and pine. The route takes us to Gumling where we only capture the serene nature. Shortly, we cross the Syar Khola again, arriving at the village of Chumling. As the day slowly comes to an end, we will have spare time to visit the monasteries of Chumling; The Panago Gompa, Mani Dhungyur, and Gurwa Gompa. This village includes telephone service as well as health posts.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Trek Duration: 5-6 hrs </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Highest Altitude: 2,386m/7,828ft</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Accommodation: Tea House/Tents </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Meals Included: (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner)</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:black\">Day 07: Trek from Chumling (2,386m/7,828ft) to Chhokang Paro (3,031m/9,944ft)</span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:black\">The destination for today is Chhokang Paro and we begin our trek early in the morning. The upper Tsum valley opens from Chhokang Paro. It is a village that is situated on flat land and is made up of two settlements which are Chhokang and Paro. As we cross the suspension bridge onto the opposite bank, we will see great views of Ganesh Himal and from the south, we can see spectacular views of Boudha Himal and Himalchuli peaks to the southwest. We continue trekking past Rainjam to Serpu Khola crossing another bridge, arriving at the Gho Village. After another two hours climb, we finally make it to the village of Chhokanparo. In this village, we will be welcomed by hospitable locals welcoming us with Tibetan tea (butter tea) and local meals.

It is on the sun side of the Shiar Khola and about twenty minutes&rsquo; walk from across Chhule. As we trek, we will pass the Piren Phu cave which is also known as the pigeon cave. This cave is one of the most sacred caves in the Tsum Valley. It is located at the foot of a rugged cliff near the village of Burji. The famous Tibetan saint called Milarepa was believed to have meditated in that cave as his footprint is imprinted on the cave. The route further is a very pleasant trek, as we will be walking past green meadows and the landscape become fertile and narrow. The farmers will be busy farming. There are two separate monasteries that are attached to the rocky cave. It is abundantly painted with Buddhist murals, excellent artistic scripts carved on the stones and long prayer flags and Buddhist paper scripts are in it that makes it one of the most important socio-cultural asset in the valley. Crossing the suspension bridge over the Shiar Khola, we will soon arrive at the Nile.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Trek Duration: 4-5 hrs </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Highest Altitude: </span><span style=\"color:black\">3,361m/11,026ft</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Accommodation: Tea House/Tents</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Meals Included: (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner)</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\"><strong>Day 09: Trek from Nile (3,361m/11,026ft) to Mu Gompa (3,700m/12,139ft), visit Dhephyudonma Gompa (4,060m/13,320ft) </strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Followed by an early morning breakfast, we will head out of Nile as the trail gradually ascends to Mu Gompa. It is the largest monastery in the region. Mu Gompa is located at the highest and the farthest point in the Tsum Valley. It was established in 1895 AD and includes many religious books including Kangyur, a life-size statue of Avalokiteshwara, and images of Guru Padmasambhava and Tara. The route takes us through yak pastures through typical dry and arid Trans Himalayan Terrain. The monastery has rows of Chortens and beautiful mountain views and houses. The historical Dephyudonma monastery connected with the dawn of Buddhism run by Lama, on the lap of the rugged mountains, is one of the oldest monasteries in the Tsum valley. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Trek Duration: 4-5 hrs </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Highest Altitude: &nbsp;4,060m/13,320ft</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Accommodation: Tea House/Tents </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Meals Included: (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner)</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:black\">Day 10: Trek from Mu Gompa (3,700m/12,139ft) to Rachen Gompa (3,240m/10,629ft)</span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Shortly after breakfast, we will head from Mu Gompa to Rechen Gompa; a nunnery following the trails.

Walking on the east bank of the Siyar Khola and crossing flat boulder-covered plains following the power lines to Rachen Gompa. Rachen Gompa has established in the year 1905 AD and is one of the largest nunneries in the Tsum valley. The interior of the Gompa is richly painted with murals about Buddhism and its history.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Trek Duration: 3-4 hrs </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Highest Altitude:&nbsp; 3,700m/12,139ft</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Accommodation: Tea House/Tents </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Meals Included: (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner)</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:black\">Day 11: Trek from Rachen Gompa (3,240m/10,629ft) to Gumba Lungdang (3,200m/10,498ft)</span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">After trekking south, we cross a bridge to the west bank passing through the Chhokangparo again. We descend down the old trail towards Chumling and approximately two hours later we will witness a small white gompa on the left at Gho (2,458m). We descend down a narrow trail that passes through a Gompa then onto a wooden bridge over the Siyar Khola. Soon, we will be crossing the bridge to Domje which has a Tibetan herbal medicine clinic and a school. Further with a steep climb through pine, juniper, and rhododendron forest, the track starts to traverse at a mani wall with many prayer flags hung. This sight of the Tibetan culture is absolutely beautiful. Finally, in the forest, there is a prayer flag that marks the uphill trail and makes a zigzag climb through a big silver pine to reach the Gompa in Lungdang.

On the route, the forest wilderness and the views make it an enjoyable and adventurous trek even though the altitude rise may cause difficulty in breathing and hiking. The route crosses through two small valleys dropping on the muddy meanders on a shortcut to regain the lower track and continue up the valley via a thick and dense forest. We will cross a small pasture, taking a right turn, we decsned the track and down to the river. The suspension bridge takes us to a bank. The trail becomes slightly challenging but we will manage to cross the forest with many winds that have thrown trees crossing the Laudang Khola on the west bank on top of an unbalanced wooden bridge. Yet again, we climb through steep rhododendron and pine forests eventually reaching on to a ridge and stone huts beside a large stone in Kharka. Shortly, we will reach a landscape with greenery. Flat grassy lands and the lateral moraine of the Torogumba Glacier. As we continue climbing up, in a couple of hours we reach the Ganesh Himal Base Camp. After appreciating and admiring the effort to reach up here, we will then return back to Gumba Lugdang as it is a short trek.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Trek Duration: 7-8 hrs</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Highest Altitude: <span style=\"background-color:white\">&nbsp;4,200m/13,779ft</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Accommodation: Tea House/Tents </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Meals Included: (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner)</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:black\">Day13: Trek Gumba Lungdang (3,200m/10,498ft) to Lokpa (2,040m/6,692ft)</span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Today we will be returning back to Lokpa.

It extends twenty kilo meters along the river. Tarap Chu is having ten villages with its cultivated fields and many gompas, chortens of both sects. Visit Tokyu monastery at 4,200m/13,776ft. This monastery also belongs to the Chaiba sect.The route leads eastward along the downhill course of Tarap Chu in a plain valley with patches of lush verdant grass on both sides of the river which is completely different from other parts of inner Dolpo. There is also a marsh which is a common feature in the Desert Mountains of Tibet and the Ladakh Himalaya. In this valley both Bon Po and Chaiba sects reside together in harmony.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Trek Duration: 4-5 hrs</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#243f60\"><span style=\"color:black\">Accommodation: </span><span style=\"color:black\">Tents</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#243f60\"><span style=\"color:black\">Meals Included: (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner)</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:black\">Day 18: Tokyu to Dho Tarap(4,040m/13,251ft)</span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">We walk east along the downhill course of Tarap Chu.

The correct name of the village is Do meaning &lsquo;lower end of the valley&rsquo; in Tibetan, but most local people refers to the village as Do Tarap. It consist of several cluster of closely packed some houses and corrals, surrounded by fields of &lsquo;Naked barley &nbsp;The Ribo Bhumpa Gompa above the village was rebuilt in 1955, beside it is unique chorten in a chorten containing the remains of a demon killed by Guru Rinpoche.

From the quite bare country around Tarap, we descend towards a wide valley which eventually narrows into a gorge. We walk along the juniper bush and wild rose, typical of dry inner Himalayan valleys, to just above the tree line. On this route we might see herds of blue sheep. By the afternoon time we reach at the confluence of the Tarap Chu and the Lang Khola, a stream that joins with Tarap River from further east. We will make our camp on a nice meadow, this place is also known as Karmakharka (3,800m/12,464ft), while our porters will perhaps take shelter in a nearby spacious cave.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Trek Duration: 6-7 hrs</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#243f60\"><span style=\"color:black\">Accommodation: </span><span style=\"color:black\">Tents</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#243f60\"><span style=\"color:black\">Meals Included: (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner)</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:black\">Day21: Tarap Khola to Khanigaon(3,150m/10,332ft)</span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">This morning again continues down the gorge of the Tarap River, at times alongside it, rising high above on a trail built from the steep slopes might come across people from Dolpo taking their herds to lower pastures for the winter. There are many possible campsites by the river. This will be one of the exciting days of this trip walk, as the valley becomes so narrow in a deep gorge that in some places we can jump from one side to another. Sometimes there is no trace of any path and we have to walk across stone slabs fitted on logs in between the walls which act as a bridge. The gorge also provides unexpected adventure and thrills. At some places, the bridges are either damaged or washed away and we may be forced to cross the icy torrent on foot.

About two hours drive east from Paro is this a unique city with unusual mixture of modern development alongside ancient traditions. Home to civil servants, expatriates and monk body, Thimphu maintains a strong national character in its architectural style. It was a wooded farming valley until 1961, when it became Bhutan\\&acute;s official national capital. The massive Tashicho Dzong, about 700 years old, was carefully revamped in the 1960s by the late King Jigme Dorji Wangchuk to house the royal and main government offices. Even today, it still only has a few streets and no traffic lights with estimated population of 70,000 people. Thimphu has many places and sights to visit, in addition to several day excursion possibilities. It has relatively more choice in terms of the accommodations.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:black\">Tashichho Dzong:</span></strong><span style=\"color:black\"> This fortress serves as the office of the King, ministers and various government organizations. It also is the headquarters for central monastic body of Bhutan. Bhutan\\&acute;s spiritual leader Je-Khenpo and the monks of both Thimphu and Punakha reside here during summer. It is also the venue for Thimphu Festival in the fall season. Weekend Market of Thimphu: starts around noon on Friday and ends on Sunday afternoon. It resembles the farmers market in the west. However since there are no big super markets, Thimphu\\&acute;s weekend market is the main source of fresh produce. It is an interesting place to visit, where village people jostle with well heeled Thimphu residents for best and cheapest vegetable and other food products. Zangto Pelri Lhakhang: Located near the Weekend Market area is one of the tallest temples and was built in 1990s by a local resident. Zangdopelri refers to the celestial abode of Guru Rinpoche.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#243f60\"><span style=\"color:black\">Accommodation: Hotel (1 night)</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#243f60\"><span style=\"color:black\">Meals Included: Lunch, Dinner </span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:black\">Day 02: Thimphu Sightseeing</span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">There are a good many things to see in the capital which has a very relaxed, laid-back feel about it.

It has fascinating collection of arts, relics, religious thangkha paintings, households stuffs, arms, handicrafts, stuffed animals and Bhutan\\&acute;s famous Stamps among others (open 10-4pm - closed on Monday).</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#243f60\"><strong><span style=\"color:black\">Kichu Lhakhang:</span></strong><span style=\"color:black\"> Tibetan King Songtsen Gompo in the 7th century miraculously built 108 temples, along with Jorkhang in Lhasa. Kyichu is considered to be one of them and is one of the oldest temples in Bhutan.</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#243f60\"><strong><span style=\"color:black\">Rinpung Dzong:</span></strong><span style=\"color:black\"> was built and consecrated in 1645 by Shabdrung Nawang Namgyal on the site of five storey castle built in 16th century. Throughout the 17th and 18th centuries it served as a bastion against invasion from the north. It is regarded as one of finest Bhutanese architecture - with intricate wood work, large beams slotted into each other and held together without nails. In it houses the giant 30m X 45m Thangka (Thongdrol), commissioned in mid 18th century, displayed on the last day of Paro Tsechu festival. Nowadays, it functions as the administrative and judicial headquarter of Paro district, and residence for the 200 monks of Paro Rabdey.</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#243f60\"><strong><span style=\"color:black\">Drukgyel Dzong:</span></strong><span style=\"color:black\"> 14kms from Paro town, at the end of the paved road stands the ruins of Drukgyel dzong (victories fortress) built in 1644-49 to commemorate the Bhutanese victory over the Tibetan-Mongol forces. It was later ruined by fire in 1951. On a clear day, Mt. Jumolhari, Bhutan\\&acute;s holy peak is seen against its backdrop.</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#243f60\"><span style=\"color:black\">Accommodation: </span><span style=\"color:black\">Hotel</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:#243f60\"><span style=\"color:black\">Meals Included: (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner)</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:black\">Day 05: Paro Sightseeing</span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:black\">Option1: Haa Valley Excursion</span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">This morning a scenic drive of 1 &amp; &frac12; hr will bring us to Chele La pass at an altitude of aprrox. 3900m/1300ft. On one side is the Paro and on the other side is Haa valley. After brief stop on the pass (as you won&rsquo;t stay long because of the strong current of wind) continue driving downhill to the forbidden district of Haa (closed to tourist until 2006). Take a tour of Haa valley and visit chorten Nagpo and Karpo and Haa Dzong if permissible. Lunch at restaurant and drive back to Paro.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">On your way back to Paro, If ypou feel like to stretch the legs you will stop at a place for the hike to a monastery called Dzondrakha which looks similar to famous Tiger&rsquo;s Nest monastery but located at shorter hiking distance. If you are energetic - walk along the agricultural field and very easy, another half will be an uphill climb and when both versions of hikes are summed up it will take less than 1 hour to reach at the top where the monastery stands. On reaching the site of the monastery, one would enjoy the view of the fertile Paro valley below. Your guide will take you inside the main temple of the monastery.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:black\">Option 2: Hike to Takstang on Pony ride </span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">You can ride the pony up to the cafeteria for stunning view of the most well known Himalayan Taktshang monastery. While coming back it is easier to walk downhill rather than riding pony which will prove dangerous.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:black\">Taktshang - Tiger\\&acute;s Nest:</span></strong><span style=\"color:black\"> Tiger\\&acute;s Lair or Tiger\\&acute;s Nest as it often referred to for Taktshang Pelphung monastery, is one of the most venerated and famous of Bhutan\\&acute;s monasteries. It is located on the face of a sheer 900m cliff above the floor of Paro valley. It is an impressive and un-miss-able sight but accessible only by walk or to ride mules/pony. If you need the riding horse, you must ask your local guide to arrange it on the previous day. From the trail head (2600m), the walk till the Cafeteria is a steep one hour uphill (about 350m ascent). From the Cafeteria (2940m) and areas around it, one can get a good close-up view of Taktshang. Savor views of the monastery over a well-deserved cup of tea and biscuits at the cafeteria.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">For those who wish to proceed further from here, one must be able to walk. Usually Ponies/horses will not take people beyond this point and neither will they take you downhill. From the cafeteria, trail continues uphill for another 45 minutes to a high observation point (3140m) where there is a Chorten (stupa). From this vantage point, the lookout to the monastery is a very spectacular and seems almost close enough to touch. It is now on the other side of a deep chasm, only around 150m away as bird flies, but takes half hour or even more to reach. Continue down the flight of cliff-hanging steps on the narrow trail to a beautiful waterfall that plunges down the deep chasm and alongside is a retreat hermitage, jammed dramatically into a rock crevice. Then climb up the flight of steep steps to the monastery. At any point on this walk, you can always return if you find it too difficult. Once inside the monastery, there are several shrines or temples to see with few monks in residence. After visiting Taktshang monastery&acirc;&euro;&trade;s many shrines, most tours schedule lunch at the Cafeteria upon return. After lunch, retrace back to the road-head where you started in the morning. The retrace back is all downhill and always on foot as it is not suitable for riding pony/horse. Please note that proper walking boots is recommended for this hike. Further, if you have more time and ready for more challenging day, there are several monasteries, temples, retreat houses in the surrounding area of Taktshang. The most notable among them are Zangdopelri and Ugyen Tsemo as described seperately.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">According to the legend, Guru Padmasambhava or Guru Rinpoche, who spread the Buddhism across the entire Himalayas is said to have flown here in the 8th century on the back of a Tigress, in order to subdue negative spiritual forces that were hostile to spread of Buddhism. In 853, one of his students, Pelgyi Senge mediated here in the main cave. A Stupa inside one of the temples contains his mortal remains and therefore the cave is known as \\&acute;Pelphung \\&acute;or \\&acute;Pelgi\\&acute;s cave\\&acute;. Subsequently many great spiritual masters such as Milarepa, Thangthong Gyalpo, Phajo Dugom Zhigpo, Shadrung and many others passed periods here in profound meditation. In 1692, Tenzin Rabgye built a two storey temple around what little may have existed previously. This was expanded and refurbished many times over the period of time. Taktshang and several temples in the area were burnt down in 1951 by fire accident but much of them remained intact and most of the relics were saved. Soon after, it was rebuilt by entire population of Tsento village. Again in April of 1998, a major fire destroyed the main structure of the building and it\\&acute;s contents. Reconstruction began in 2000 and was completed and consecrated after extensive efforts and financial support of Governments as well as donors.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:black\">Beyond Takstang Description:Takstang</span></strong><span style=\"color:black\"> (Tiger\\&acute;s Lair) - or Taktsang Pelphung is one of the most venerated and famous of Bhutan\\&acute;s monasteries. It is located on the face of a sheer 1000m cliff above Paro valley. It is an impressive sight but accessible only by trek or on pony.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">The walk to the Tea house is a steep one hour uphill (about 350m ascent). From the tea house or Cafeteria (2940m), one can get a close-up view of Takstang and most actually return back from here. After tea, snacks and rest, we will trek further uphill to a high observation point (3140m), where there is a Chorten (stupa). Continue down the flight of cliff-hanging steps on the narrow trail to a beautiful waterfall that plunges down the chasm and alongside is a retreat hermitage.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Legend has it that Guru Padmasambhava, the great Buddhist master of Oddiyana (present day in Pakistan), who spread the Buddhism across the entire Himalayas is said to have flown here in 8th century on the back of a Tigress, to subdue negative spiritual forces that were hostile to spread of Buddhism. In 853, one of his students Pelgyi Senge mediated here in the main cave. A Stupa at the main cave contains Pelgyi\\&acute;s mortal remains and therefore the cave is therefore known as Pelphung or Pelgyi\\&acute;s cave. Subsequently many great spiritual masters passed periods here in profound meditation. In 1692, Tenzin Rabgye built a two storey temple here, which over the period of time was expanded and refurbished. In April 1998, tragically, two of the three temples were completely burnt by fire. It has now been restored to its original splendor. After returning from the visit to monastery, we will hike further uphill from the observatory point (described earlier) to Zangdopelri temple (3250m). From here, we can actually look down on the temple, with air distance of not more than 500 meters, providing a unique view. Then if you are can, we can trek for another &Acirc;&frac12; hour further up to Ugyen Tsemo temple with great view of the valley. Depending on the trail conditions, after Ugyen Tshemo, you can walk back using different route which joins at the end. Return to Paro.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:black\">Drukgyel Dzong:</span></strong><span style=\"color:black\"> Drukgyal Dzong ruins is located 14kms north of Paro town, near the end of the paved road.

We prefer you reach Shitkadi in the transport arranged by us.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color:white\">&nbsp;Stay updated into news about Kashmir Valley. Be curious about what&rsquo;s happening around you. Keep a check of areas that are flagged red. Check if transport is getting affected and be forthcoming on enquiring about alternate routes. Our team will always be there with you throughout your travel and will keep you posted in case of any unrest in the valley.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color:white\">If you&rsquo;re coming a day before and staying overnight at Srinagar, stay in touristy areas like Dal Lake or Lal Chowk.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color:white\">Avoid going to downtown areas. Stick to tourist spaces as they tend to be safer and well-protected during times of unrest.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, the Tarsar Marsar coordinates remain untouched during times of unrest, getting to the base camp involves traveling through populated towns like Bhijbera and Anantnag in the picturesque countryside of Kashmir.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>"

The summit climb involves fixing a rope to negotiate a 75-100 feet vertical wall of slope making it extremely technical and challenging. Utmost care needs to be taken at this point. The slope being very steep, it is important for the lead climber to open and fix the route leading to a ridgeline. Finally, you reach the summit. The summit of Black Peak (Kalanag) is flat. Take some photos of your spectacular endeavor to cherish this moment. Don&rsquo;t spend a lot of time at this extreme altitude and start to descend down to your summit camp and Camp 1 and if possible to your base camp.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Accommodation: Tents </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Meals: Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:black\">DAY 12: RESERVE DAY </span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Reserve a day for summit climb if the weather does not allow you to summit the day before.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Accommodation: Tents </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">Meals: Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:black\">DAY 13: SUMMIT CAMP TO BASE CAMP (3500M)</span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:black\">This day we shall wrap up our summit camp and camp1 and move to our base camp.

From Gangotri, you may move along the beaten track towards Chirbasa, which is on the tree line. The entire trek till Chirbasa is along the roaring Bhagirathi River. We can have our pack lunch in Chirbasa. From Chirbasa, we trek further to Bhojwasa today. The trek is going to be moderate for the day. The terrain, after Chirbasa, becomes really desolate and barren. In fact, it has been referred to as Arctic Tundra by many trekkers. The entire trail passes through the dense forest till Bhojwasa. There is a small temple and a potential campsite near the river. Good place to camp for the day. Excellent sunset on Bhagirathi group of peaks to delight you in the evening.</span></span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;\"><span style=\"color:black\">Accommodation:&nbsp; Tents</span></span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;\"><span style=\"color:black\">Meals: Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner</span></span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><strong><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;\"><span style=\"color:black\">Day05: Bhojwasa to Tapovan (4460 M) via - Gomukh (3900 M) </span></span></span></strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;\"><span style=\"color:black\">Early in the Morning enjoy the panoramic view of the Bhagirathi group of peaks. After breakfast trek to Gomukh (3890mt), the source of the Ganges. Gomukh is where the water of Ganga trickles down from the glaciers. The sages called it &#39;Gomukh&#39; because, in the distant past, it probably appeared like a cow&#39;s mouth. Explore the area and trek to Tapovan, one of the finest high altitude alpine meadows in the area. The trek from Gomukh to Tapovan is ascent steep, and as we climb, the view of the surrounding peaks becomes clearer. Tapovan known for its beautiful meadows that encircle the base camp of the Shivling peak, Tapovan is a very pleasant surprised spot with a large meadow complete with bubbling streams, wildflowers, and campsites. Herds of Bharal (blue mountain goats) are a common sight from here on mountain ridges. On the far side of the glacier the Bhagirathi I, II, III (6454mt), provide an equally impressive backdrop. It is also the little wonder where Sadhus and saints choose this spot for extended meditation during the long summer month. </span></span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;\"><span style=\"color:black\">Accommodation:&nbsp; Tents</span></span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;\"><span style=\"color:black\">Meals: Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner</span></span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><strong><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;\"><span style=\"color:black\">Day 06: Tapovan to Nandanvan (4350 M) via Meru Glacier </span></span></span></strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;\"><span style=\"color:black\">On this day we start early &amp; head to the great Meru Glacier.

From Gomukh turn towards Nandanvan (4340m) and steering on right one will be on top of the Gangotri glacier. The glacier runs between two ranges and the landslides make a layer of rocky moraine on the ice which makes the walking easier. The glacier walk is very slippery and a slight lack of concentration would be dangerous. Huge crevasses gaped here and there. After walking for about a kilometer there is a vertical ascent. Big rocks en route offer grips and footholds but many of them are deceptive too.</span></span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;\"><span style=\"color:black\">Accommodation:&nbsp; Tents</span></span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;\"><span style=\"color:black\">Meals: Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner</span></span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><strong><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;\"><span style=\"color:black\">Day 07: Nandanvan to Vasuki Tal (4880 M) </span></span></span></strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:12.0pt\"><span style=\"font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;\"><span style=\"color:black\">Morning trek along with Chaturangi Glacier to reach Vasuki Tal, a beautiful base for Mt Satopanth and Mt Vasuki Parbat with a small lake.

The team members of UFORangers will be carrying all the necessary gear, equipment, and first aid kits and they have extensive first aid training. If a trekker falls sick at a high altitude, the leader will decide whether to continue the trek. In case of emergency, UFORangers has a rescue helicopter to bring you back from the higher elevation. Moreover, UFORangers also provides an oximeter to monitor the oxygen level at high altitude and offers regular health check-up facilities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Lukla Airport convenient for the flight?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lukla is at 9,500 feet 2,850m above sea level. The higher the altitude, the lower the air density. So, the planes need to land at faster speeds. The weather in this area changes constantly and the cloud cover can be extreme, leading to major turbulence, which, though not dangerous, tends to be tough for passengers to endure. However, it is actually the country&rsquo;s busiest airport serving as the key port of entry and exit for trekkers hoping to ascend Everest. UFORangers will try to make your flight pleasant in any circumstances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What if my flight to and from Lukla is cancelled or delayed?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The flights are usually regular between October and May. But due to high altitude, bad weather, and unforeseen technical issues, you may experience a delay or cancellation of the flight. On the occurrence of such events, UFORangers charters a helicopter to make sure you are on the safe schedule either for a trek or for your flight back home which would cost extra charge as an unexpected event. However, if the visibility is less than 1,500 meters, it is unable to operate helicopter facilities and UFORangers will reschedule the flight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Do I need any permits before starting the trek to Everest High Passes?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>You need Trekkers&rsquo; Information Management Systems (TIMS) card and Sagarmatha National Park Entry Permit. UFORangers will help you with all those necessary paperwork and let you enjoy your holidays to the fullest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Do I need Travel Insurance to trek in Everest Region?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>You need travel insurance prior to booking the trek which must cover medical and emergency repatriation inclusive of helicopter rescue and evacuation expenses at high altitude for trekking members, which should be provided to us before you start your trekking. UFORangers will help you to get travel insurance for potential altitude sickness and unforeseen events due to sudden climate change.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What about the Insurance of guides and porters?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes, UFORangers ensures the expenses for insurance of its guides, porters, and all the crews along with meals, salary, lodging, transportation, and other necessary equipment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Is there any age limit or criteria for trekking to Everest High Passes?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is not an age limit but UFORangers does not recommend children to climb high altitudes as this may have severe effects on a child&#39;s health. However, you need to be in a good physique with a positive attitude. UFORangers does not recommend this trek to those who suffer from sensitive medical conditions such as heart or lung disease.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What is the luggage limit for porter and flight to Lukla?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>UFORangers will provide one porter for two trekkers to carry 20 kgs of luggage (maximum 10 kg for each trekker).

UFORangers can make arrangements if you wish to avoid the crowds in these seasons, DWT can make it happen in any season you want with all the safeties and fun.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How safe is trekking/clmbing?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>UFORangers guarantees 3S for the clients: safety, security, and satisfaction. The team members of UFORangers will be carrying all the necessary gear, equipment, and first aid kits and they have extensive first aid training. If a trekker falls sick at a high altitude, the leader will decide whether to continue the trek. In case of emergency, UFORangers has a rescue helicopter to bring you back from the higher elevation. Moreover, UFORangers also provides an oximeter to monitor the oxygen levels at high altitudes and offers regular health check-up facilities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How to avoid altitude sickness in Trekking/climbing?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Cut off caffeinated, alcoholic, and smoking items.</li>\r\n\t<li>Drink at least 4 liters of water a day.</li>\r\n\t<li>Trek slow.</li>\r\n\t<li>Don&#39;t skip the acclimatization days.</li>\r\n\t<li>Better to continue with Diamox (if any symptoms show up).</li>\r\n\t<li>Drink Garlic Soup.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How long do I need to walk per day during my trek to Trekking/climbing?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The hiking will be 5-7 hours a day depending upon the landscape and destination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Is Lukla Airport convenient for the flight?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lukla is at 9,500 feet 2,850m above sea level. The higher the altitude, the lower the air density. So, the planes need to land at faster speeds. The weather in this area changes constantly and the cloud cover can be extreme, leading to major turbulence, which, though not dangerous, tends to be tough for passengers to endure. However, it is actually the country&rsquo;s busiest airport serving as the key port of entry and exit for trekkers hoping to ascend Everest. UFORangers will try to make your flight pleasant in any circumstances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What if my flight to and from Lukla is cancelled or delayed?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The flights are usually regular between October and May. But due to high altitude, bad weather, and unforeseen technical issues, you may experience a delay or cancellation of the flight. On the occurrence of such events, UFORangers charters a helicopter to make sure you are on the safe schedule either for the trek or for your flight back home which would cost extra charge as an unexpected event. However, if the visibility is less than 1,500 meters, it is unable to operate helicopter facilities and UFORangers will reschedule the flight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Do I need any permits before starting the trek /climbing?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>You need Climbing Permits and Sagarmatha National Park Entry Permit. UFORangers will help you with all those necessary paperwork and let you enjoy your holidays to the fullest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Do I need Travel Insurance to trek/climb in Everest Region?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>You need travel insurance prior to booking the trek which must cover medical and emergency repatriation inclusive of helicopter rescue and evacuation expenses at high altitude for trekking members, which should be provided to us before you start your trekking. UFORangers will help you to get travel insurance for potential altitude sickness and unforeseen events due to sudden climate change.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What about the Insurance of guides and porters?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>UFORangers ensures the expenses for insurance of its guides, porters, and all the crews along with meals, salary, lodging, transportation, and other necessary equipment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Is there any luggage limit for porter?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>UFORangers will provide one porter for two trekkers to carry 18 kgs of luggage (maximum 9 kg for each trekker). Please be sure your porters are not overloaded because they do not carry only your equipment but also lift your spirit to reach new heights, and your love, affection, and generosity can be the reason for them to work hard to take you to your destination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>What is the weather condition at Everest region?</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Weather on the trail to the Everest region is always changing and impossible to predict.

On the occurrence of such events, UFORangers charters a helicopter to make sure you are on the safe schedule either for the trek or for your flight back home which would cost extra charge as an unexpected event. However, if the visibility is less than 1,500 meters, it is unable to operate helicopter facilities and UFORangers will reschedule the flight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Do I need any permits before starting the trek /climbing?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>You need Climbing Permits and Sagarmatha National Park Entry Permit.

UFORangers can make arrangements if you wish to avoid the crowds in these seasons, DWT can make it happen in any season you want with all the safeties and fun.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How safe is trekking/clmbing?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>UFORangers guarantees 3S for the clients: safety, security, and satisfaction. The team members of UFORangers will be carrying all the necessary gear, equipment, and first aid kits and they have extensive first aid training. If a trekker falls sick at a high altitude, the leader will decide whether to continue the trek. In case of emergency, UFORangers has a rescue helicopter to bring you back from the higher elevation. Moreover, UFORangers also provides an oximeter to monitor the oxygen levels at high altitudes and offers regular health check-up facilities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How to avoid altitude sickness in Trekking/climbing?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Cut off caffeinated, alcoholic, and smoking items.</li>\r\n\t<li>Drink at least 4 liters of water a day.</li>\r\n\t<li>Trek slow.</li>\r\n\t<li>Don&#39;t skip the acclimatization days.</li>\r\n\t<li>Better to continue with Diamox (if any symptoms show up).</li>\r\n\t<li>Drink Garlic Soup.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How long do I need to walk per day during my trek to Trekking/climbing?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The hiking will be 5-7 hours a day depending upon the landscape and destination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Is Lukla Airport convenient for the flight?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lukla is at 9,500 feet 2,850m above sea level. The higher the altitude, the lower the air density. So, the planes need to land at faster speeds. The weather in this area changes constantly and the cloud cover can be extreme, leading to major turbulence, which, though not dangerous, tends to be tough for passengers to endure. However, it is actually the country&rsquo;s busiest airport serving as the key port of entry and exit for trekkers hoping to ascend Everest. UFORangers will try to make your flight pleasant in any circumstances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What if my flight to and from Lukla is cancelled or delayed?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The flights are usually regular between October and May. But due to high altitude, bad weather, and unforeseen technical issues, you may experience a delay or cancellation of the flight. On the occurrence of such events, UFORangers charters a helicopter to make sure you are on the safe schedule either for the trek or for your flight back home which would cost extra charge as an unexpected event. However, if the visibility is less than 1,500 meters, it is unable to operate helicopter facilities and UFORangers will reschedule the flight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Do I need any permits before starting the trek /climbing?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>You need Climbing Permits and Sagarmatha National Park Entry Permit. UFORangers will help you with all those necessary paperwork and let you enjoy your holidays to the fullest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Do I need Travel Insurance to trek/climb in Everest Region?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>You need travel insurance prior to booking the trek which must cover medical and emergency repatriation inclusive of helicopter rescue and evacuation expenses at high altitude for trekking members, which should be provided to us before you start your trekking. UFORangers will help you to get travel insurance for potential altitude sickness and unforeseen events due to sudden climate change.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What about the Insurance of guides and porters?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>UFORangers ensures the expenses for insurance of its guides, porters, and all the crews along with meals, salary, lodging, transportation, and other necessary equipment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Is there any luggage limit for porter?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>UFORangers will provide one porter for two trekkers to carry 18 kgs of luggage (maximum 9 kg for each trekker). Please be sure your porters are not overloaded because they do not carry only your equipment but also lift your spirit to reach new heights, and your love, affection, and generosity can be the reason for them to work hard to take you to your destination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>What is the weather condition at Everest region?</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Weather on the trail to the Everest region is always changing and impossible to predict.

UFORangers can make arrangements if you wish to avoid the crowds in these seasons, DWT can make it happen in any season you want with all the safeties and fun.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How safe is trekking/clmbing?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>UFORangers guarantees 3S for the clients: safety, security, and satisfaction. The team members of UFORangers will be carrying all the necessary gear, equipment, and first aid kits and they have extensive first aid training. If a trekker falls sick at a high altitude, the leader will decide whether to continue the trek. In case of emergency, UFORangers has a rescue helicopter to bring you back from the higher elevation. Moreover, UFORangers also provides an oximeter to monitor the oxygen levels at high altitudes and offers regular health check-up facilities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How to avoid altitude sickness in Trekking/climbing?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Cut off caffeinated, alcoholic, and smoking items.</li>\r\n\t<li>Drink at least 4 liters of water a day.</li>\r\n\t<li>Trek slow.</li>\r\n\t<li>Don&#39;t skip the acclimatization days.</li>\r\n\t<li>Better to continue with Diamox (if any symptoms show up).</li>\r\n\t<li>Drink Garlic Soup.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How long do I need to walk per day during my trek to Trekking/climbing?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The hiking will be 5-7 hours a day depending upon the landscape and destination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Is Lukla Airport convenient for the flight?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lukla is at 9,500 feet 2,850m above sea level. The higher the altitude, the lower the air density. So, the planes need to land at faster speeds. The weather in this area changes constantly and the cloud cover can be extreme, leading to major turbulence, which, though not dangerous, tends to be tough for passengers to endure. However, it is actually the country&rsquo;s busiest airport serving as the key port of entry and exit for trekkers hoping to ascend Everest. UFORangers will try to make your flight pleasant in any circumstances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What if my flight to and from Lukla is cancelled or delayed?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The flights are usually regular between October and May. But due to high altitude, bad weather, and unforeseen technical issues, you may experience a delay or cancellation of the flight. On the occurrence of such events, UFORangers charters a helicopter to make sure you are on the safe schedule either for the trek or for your flight back home which would cost extra charge as an unexpected event. However, if the visibility is less than 1,500 meters, it is unable to operate helicopter facilities and UFORangers will reschedule the flight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Do I need any permits before starting the trek /climbing?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>You need Climbing Permits and Sagarmatha National Park Entry Permit. UFORangers will help you with all those necessary paperwork and let you enjoy your holidays to the fullest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Do I need Travel Insurance to trek/climb in Everest Region?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>You need travel insurance prior to booking the trek which must cover medical and emergency repatriation inclusive of helicopter rescue and evacuation expenses at high altitude for trekking members, which should be provided to us before you start your trekking. UFORangers will help you to get travel insurance for potential altitude sickness and unforeseen events due to sudden climate change.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What about the Insurance of guides and porters?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>UFORangers ensures the expenses for insurance of its guides, porters, and all the crews along with meals, salary, lodging, transportation, and other necessary equipment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Is there any luggage limit for porter?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>UFORangers will provide one porter for two trekkers to carry 18 kgs of luggage (maximum 9 kg for each trekker). Please be sure your porters are not overloaded because they do not carry only your equipment but also lift your spirit to reach new heights, and your love, affection, and generosity can be the reason for them to work hard to take you to your destination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>What is the weather condition at Everest region?</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Weather on the trail to the Everest region is always changing and impossible to predict.

Is there any possible option to avoid it?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>UFORangers has a well-trained group of team members to deal with these issues. Our team member has oximeter to monitor the oxygen level at high altitude and have regular health check-up facilities. UFORangers also provides emergency rescue service. However, you can reduce the chances of altitude sickness by:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Cutting off caffeinated, alcoholic, and smoking items</li>\r\n\t<li>Drinking at least 4 liters of water a day</li>\r\n\t<li>Trekking slowly</li>\r\n\t<li>Not skipping the acclimatization days</li>\r\n\t<li>Continuing with Diamox, if any symptoms show up</li>\r\n\t<li>Drinking Garlic Soup</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What is the lodging like in Annapurna Region Trek?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>UFORangers manages a teahouse/lodge accommodation during the trek. Generally, there are twin sharing rooms and squat style toilets, normally outside the room or house. Teahouses/lodges provide blankets but it&rsquo;s a good idea to bring your own sleeping bag as there are no heating systems inside the rooms. Some places may offer hot gas and running water for a shower with an additional fee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Do I need any permits to start my trek of Annapurna Region&nbsp;?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes, you need Trekker&rsquo;s Information System (TIMS) Card and the Annapurna Conservation Area Permit (ACAP) to start your trek.

But you cannot use plastic bottles in the Annapurna region. So, they do not sell plastic bottled mineral water. You need to drink mineral water or boiled or filtered water in those areas. It is better to use water purification drops and tablets which you can either bring from your own country or buy in Kathmandu or Pokhara. UFORangers also provides water purifier pills.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Do I need to bring my own medicines for Annapurna Region Trek?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are allergic to specific medicines, it is better to consult your doctor and bring your own.

The team members of UFORangers will be carrying all the necessary gear, equipment, and first aid kits and they have extensive first aid training. If a trekker falls sick at a high altitude, the leader will decide whether to continue the trek. In case of emergency, UFORangers has a rescue helicopter to bring you back from the higher elevation. Moreover, UFORangers also provides an oximeter to monitor the oxygen levels at high altitudes and offers regular health check-up facilities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How to avoid altitude sickness in Trekking/climbing?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Cut off caffeinated, alcoholic, and smoking items.</li>\r\n\t<li>Drink at least 4 liters of water a day.</li>\r\n\t<li>Trek slow.</li>\r\n\t<li>Don&#39;t skip the acclimatization days.</li>\r\n\t<li>Better to continue with Diamox (if any symptoms show up).</li>\r\n\t<li>Drink Garlic Soup.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How long do I need to walk per day during my trek to Trekking/climbing?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The hiking will be 5-7 hours a day depending upon the landscape and destination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What if my flight to and from Tumlingtar is cancelled or delayed?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The flights are usually regular between October and May. But due to high altitude, bad weather, and unforeseen technical issues, you may experience a delay or cancellation of the flight. On the occurrence of such events, UFORangers charters a helicopter to make sure you are on the safe schedule either for the trek or for your flight back home which would cost extra charge as an unexpected event. However, if the visibility is less than 1,500 meters, it is unable to operate helicopter facilities and UFORangers will reschedule the flight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Do I need any permits before starting the trek /climbing?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>You need Climbing Permits and Sagarmatha National Park Entry Permit.

We maintain a systemized approach at assessing your fitness level and it is a complete remote process. You can take up this assessment at your home or in an open space close to your home. Assessing and recording your baseline fitness scores will give your program a benchmark to monitor progress. The assessments will further be done on a regular basis as the program proceeds.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong>PROGRAM DESIGN</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\">The fitness level assessment results will allow us to design a program based on your current fitness level and the fitness goals set by you. It will involve choosing activities you like from a pool of other activities, that you take up during the program. Weekly progressions will be decided and activities are allotted according to your daily routine.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong>PROGRAM EXECUTION AND MONITORING&nbsp;</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\">Once the program is defined, the fitness routine will take off gradually, from less intense to more intense activities. The progress will be documented on a daily basis and monitored by our experts. Amendments can be made if there are any changes in your schedule occasionally. But we highly recommend sticking to the schedule fixed with our experts at the start of the program. Fitness level progress will be monitored on a regular basis throughout the course of the program.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong><u>WHY TAKE PERSONALISED FITNESS PROGRAM?</u></strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li style=\"list-style-type:disc\"><span style=\"color:#000000\">Designed according to your </span><span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong>needs, goals,</strong></span><span style=\"color:#000000\"> and </span><span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong>routine</strong></span><span style=\"color:#000000\">.&nbsp;</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"list-style-type:disc\"><span style=\"color:#000000\">Regular fitness and progress tracking.</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"list-style-type:disc\"><span style=\"color:#000000\">Reduced chances of injury.</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"list-style-type:disc\"><span style=\"color:#000000\">Choice of activities you like.</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"list-style-type:disc\"><span style=\"color:#000000\">Varied Activities - eliminates boredom and monotony.</span></li>\r\n\t<li style=\"list-style-type:disc\"><span style=\"color:#000000\">Guaranteed fitness level achievement.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>",
